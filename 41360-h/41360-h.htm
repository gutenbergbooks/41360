<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br /><br />

<small>SUBJECT OF OUR STUDY: RELIGIOUS SOCIOLOGY AND
THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE</small></h2>


<p>In this book we propose to study the most primitive and simple
religion which is actually known, to make an analysis of it,
and to attempt an explanation of it. A religious system may be
said to be the most primitive which we can observe when it fulfils
the two following conditions: in the first place, when it is found
in a society whose organization is surpassed by no others in
simplicity;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and secondly, when it is possible to explain it
without making use of any element borrowed from a previous
religion.</p>

<p>We shall set ourselves to describe the organization of this
system with all the exactness and fidelity that an ethnographer
or an historian could give it. But our task will not be limited to
that: sociology raises other problems than history or ethnography.
It does not seek to know the passed forms of civilization
with the sole end of knowing them and reconstructing them. But
rather, like every positive science, it has as its object the explanation
of some actual reality which is near to us, and which
consequently is capable of affecting our ideas and our acts: this
reality is man, and more precisely, the man of to-day, for there is
nothing which we are more interested in knowing. Then we are
not going to study a very archaic religion simply for the pleasure
of telling its peculiarities and its singularities. If we have taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
it as the subject of our research, it is because it has seemed to us
better adapted than any other to lead to an understanding of the
religious nature of man, that is to say, to show us an essential and
permanent aspect of humanity.</p>

<p>But this proposition is not accepted before the raising of strong
objections. It seems very strange that one must turn back, and
be transported to the very beginnings of history, in order to arrive
at an understanding of humanity as it is at present. This manner
of procedure seems particularly paradoxical in the question which
concerns us. In fact, the various religions generally pass as being
quite unequal in value and dignity; it is said that they do not all
contain the same quota of truth. Then it seems as though one
could not compare the highest forms of religious thought with the
lowest, without reducing the first to the level of the second. If
we admit that the crude cults of the Australian tribes can help us
to understand Christianity, for example, is that not supposing
that this latter religion proceeds from the same mentality as the
former, that it is made up of the same superstitions and rests
upon the same errors? This is how the theoretical importance
which has sometimes been attributed to primitive religions has
come to pass as a sign of a systematic hostility to all religion,
which, by prejudging the results of the study, vitiates them in
advance.</p>

<p>There is no occasion for asking here whether or not there are
scholars who have merited this reproach, and who have made
religious history and ethnology a weapon against religion. In
any case, a sociologist cannot hold such a point of view. In fact,
it is an essential postulate of sociology that a human institution
cannot rest upon an error and a lie, without which it could not
exist. If it were not founded in the nature of things, it would
have encountered in the facts a resistance over which it could
never have triumphed. So when we commence the study of
primitive religions, it is with the assurance that they hold to
reality and express it; this principle will be seen to re-enter again
and again in the course of the analyses and discussions which
follow, and the reproach which we make against the schools from
which we have separated ourselves is that they have ignored it.
When only the letter of the formul&aelig; is considered, these religious
beliefs and practices undoubtedly seem disconcerting at times,
and one is tempted to attribute them to some sort of a deep-rooted
error. But one must know how to go underneath the
symbol to the reality which it represents and which gives it its
meaning. The most barbarous and the most fantastic rites and
the strangest myths translate some human need, some aspect of
life, either individual or social. The reasons with which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
faithful justify them may be, and generally are, erroneous; but
the true reasons do not cease to exist, and it is the duty of science
to discover them.</p>

<p>In reality, then, there are no religions which are false. All are
true in their own fashion; all answer, though in different ways,
to the given conditions of human existence. It is undeniably
possible to arrange them in a hierarchy. Some can be called
superior to others, in the sense that they call into play higher
mental functions, that they are richer in ideas and sentiments,
that they contain more concepts with fewer sensations and
images, and that their arrangement is wiser. But howsoever real
this greater complexity and this higher ideality may be, they are
not sufficient to place the corresponding religions in different
classes. All are religions equally, just as all living beings are
equally alive, from the most humble plastids up to man. So when
we turn to primitive religions it is not with the idea of depreciating
religion in general, for these religions are no less respectable than
the others. They respond to the same needs, they play the same
r&ocirc;le, they depend upon the same causes; they can also well serve
to show the nature of the religious life, and consequently to resolve
the problem which we wish to study.</p>


<p class="npara">But why give them a sort of prerogative? Why choose them
in preference to all others as the subject of our study?&mdash;It is
merely for reasons of method.</p>

<p>In the first place, we cannot arrive at an understanding of the
most recent religions except by following the manner in which
they have been progressively composed in history. In fact,
historical analysis is the only means of explanation which it is
possible to apply to them. It alone enables us to resolve an
institution into its constituent elements, for it shows them to us
as they are born in time, one after another. On the other hand,
by placing every one of them in the condition where it was born,
it puts into our hands the only means we have of determining the
causes which gave rise to it. Every time that we undertake to
explain something human, taken at a given moment in history&mdash;be
it a religious belief, a moral precept, a legal principle, an
&aelig;sthetic style or an economic system&mdash;it is necessary to commence
by going back to its most primitive and simple form, to try to
account for the characteristics by which it was marked at that
time, and then to show how it developed and became complicated
little by little, and how it became that which it is at the moment
in question. One readily understands the importance which the
determination of the point of departure has for this series of progressive
explanations, for all the others are attached to it. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
one of Descartes's principles that the first ring has a predominating
place in the chain of scientific truths. But there is no question of
placing at the foundation of the science of religions an idea
elaborated after the cartesian manner, that is to say, a logical
concept, a pure possibility, constructed simply by force of thought.
What we must find is a concrete reality, and historical and ethnological
observation alone can reveal that to us. But even if this
cardinal conception is obtained by a different process than that of
Descartes, it remains true that it is destined to have a considerable
influence on the whole series of propositions which the science
establishes. Biological evolution has been conceived quite
differently ever since it has been known that monocellular beings
do exist. In the same way, the arrangement of religious facts is
explained quite differently, according as we put naturism,
animism or some other religious form at the beginning of the
evolution. Even the most specialized scholars, if they are unwilling
to confine themselves to a task of pure erudition, and if
they desire to interpret the facts which they analyse, are obliged
to choose one of these hypotheses, and make it their starting-point.
Whether they desire it or not, the questions which they
raise necessarily take the following form: how has naturism or
animism been led to take this particular form, here or there, or to
enrich itself or impoverish itself in such and such a fashion?
Since it is impossible to avoid taking sides on this initial problem,
and since the solution given is destined to affect the whole science,
it must be attacked at the outset: that is what we propose to do.</p>

<p>Besides this, outside of these indirect reactions, the study of
primitive religions has of itself an immediate interest which is of
primary importance.</p>

<p>If it is useful to know what a certain particular religion consists
in, it is still more important to know what religion in general is.
This is the problem which has aroused the interest of philosophers
in all times; and not without reason, for it is of interest to all
humanity. Unfortunately, the method which they generally
employ is purely dialectic: they confine themselves to analysing
the idea which they make for themselves of religion, except as
they illustrate the results of this mental analysis by examples
borrowed from the religions which best realize their ideal. But
even if this method ought to be abandoned, the problem remains
intact, and the great service of philosophy is to have prevented
its being suppressed by the disdain of scholars. Now it is possible
to attack it in a different way. Since all religions can be compared
to each other, and since all are species of the same class,
there are necessarily many elements which are common to all.
We do not mean to speak simply of the outward and visible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
characteristics which they all have equally, and which make it
possible to give them a provisional definition from the very outset
of our researches; the discovery of these apparent signs is relatively
easy, for the observation which it demands does not go beneath
the surface of things. But these external resemblances suppose
others which are profound. At the foundation of all systems of
beliefs and of all cults there ought necessarily to be a certain
number of fundamental representations or conceptions and of
ritual attitudes which, in spite of the diversity of forms which
they have taken, have the same objective significance and fulfil
the same functions everywhere. These are the permanent
elements which constitute that which is permanent and human
in religion; they form all the objective contents of the idea which
is expressed when one speaks of <i>religion</i> in general. How is it
possible to pick them out?</p>

<p>Surely it is not by observing the complex religions which appear
in the course of history. Every one of these is made up of such
a variety of elements that it is very difficult to distinguish what
is secondary from what is principal, the essential from the
accessory. Suppose that the religion considered is like that of
Egypt, India or the classical antiquity. It is a confused mass of
many cults, varying according to the locality, the temples, the
generations, the dynasties, the invasions, etc. Popular superstitions
are there confused with the purest dogmas. Neither the
thought nor the activity of the religion is evenly distributed
among the believers; according to the men, the environment
and the circumstances, the beliefs as well as the rites are thought
of in different ways. Here they are priests, there they are
monks, elsewhere they are laymen; there are mystics and
rationalists, theologians and prophets, etc. In these conditions it
is difficult to see what is common to all. In one or another of
these systems it is quite possible to find the means of making a
profitable study of some particular fact which is specially
developed there, such as sacrifice or prophecy, monasticism or
the mysteries; but how is it possible to find the common foundation
of the religious life underneath the luxuriant vegetation
which covers it? How is it possible to find, underneath the
disputes of theology, the variations of ritual, the multiplicity of
groups and the diversity of individuals, the fundamental states
characteristic of religious mentality in general?</p>

<p>Things are quite different in the lower societies. The slighter
development of individuality, the small extension of the group,
the homogeneity of external circumstances, all contribute to
reducing the differences and variations to a minimum. The
group has an intellectual and moral conformity of which we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
but rare examples in the more advanced societies. Everything
is common to all. Movements are stereotyped; everybody
performs the same ones in the same circumstances, and this
conformity of conduct only translates the conformity of thought.
Every mind being drawn into the same eddy, the individual
type nearly confounds itself with that of the race. And while all
is uniform, all is simple as well. Nothing is deformed like these
myths, all composed of one and the same theme which is endlessly
repeated, or like these rites made up of a small number of gestures
repeated again and again. Neither the popular imagination nor
that of the priests has had either the time or the means of refining
and transforming the original substance of the religious ideas
and practices; these are shown in all their nudity, and offer themselves
to an examination, it requiring only the slightest effort to
lay them open. That which is accessory or secondary, the development
of luxury, has not yet come to hide the principal elements.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
All is reduced to that which is indispensable, to that without
which there could be no religion. But that which is indispensable
is also that which is essential, that is to say, that which we must
know before all else.</p>

<p>Primitive civilizations offer privileged cases, then, because they
are simple cases. That is why, in all fields of human activity, the
observations of ethnologists have frequently been veritable
revelations, which have renewed the study of human institutions.
For example, before the middle of the nineteenth century, everybody
was convinced that the father was the essential element of
the family; no one had dreamed that there could be a family
organization of which the paternal authority was not the keystone.
But the discovery of Bachofen came and upset this old
conception. Up to very recent times it was regarded as evident
that the moral and legal relations of kindred were only another
aspect of the psychological relations which result from a common
descent; Bachofen and his successors, MacLennan, Morgan and
many others still laboured under this misunderstanding. But
since we have become acquainted with the nature of the primitive
clan, we know that, on the contrary, relationships cannot be
explained by consanguinity. To return to religions, the study
of only the most familiar ones had led men to believe for a long
time that the idea of god was characteristic of everything that is
religious. Now the religion which we are going to study presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
is, in a large part, foreign to all idea of divinity; the forces to
which the rites are there addressed are very different from those
which occupy the leading place in our modern religions, yet they
aid us in understanding these latter forces. So nothing is more
unjust than the disdain with which too many historians still
regard the work of ethnographers. Indeed, it is certain that
ethnology has frequently brought about the most fruitful revolutions
in the different branches of sociology. It is for this same
reason that the discovery of unicellular beings, of which we just
spoke, has transformed the current idea of life. Since in these
very simple beings, life is reduced to its essential traits, these are
less easily misunderstood.</p>

<p>But primitive religions do not merely aid us in disengaging the
constituent elements of religion; they also have the great advantage
that they facilitate the explanation of it. Since the
facts there are simpler, the relations between them are more
apparent. The reasons with which men account for their acts
have not yet been elaborated and denatured by studied reflection;
they are nearer and more closely related to the motives which
have really determined these acts. In order to understand an
hallucination perfectly, and give it its most appropriate treatment,
a physician must know its original point of departure.
Now this event is proportionately easier to find if he can observe
it near its beginnings. The longer the disease is allowed to develop,
the more it evades observation; that is because all sorts of
interpretations have intervened as it advanced, which tend to
force the original state into the background, and across which
it is frequently difficult to find the initial one. Between a
systematized hallucination and the first impressions which gave
it birth, the distance is often considerable. It is the same thing
with religious thought. In proportion as it progresses in history,
the causes which called it into existence, though remaining active,
are no longer perceived, except across a vast scheme of interpretations
which quite transform them. Popular mythologies
and subtile theologies have done their work: they have superimposed
upon the primitive sentiments others which are quite
different, and which, though holding to the first, of which they are
an elaborated form, only allow their true nature to appear very
imperfectly. The psychological gap between the cause and the
effect, between the apparent cause and the effective cause, has
become more considerable and more difficult for the mind to
leap. The remainder of this book will be an illustration and a
verification of this remark on method. It will be seen how, in
the primitive religions, the religious fact still visibly carries the
mark of its origins: it would have been well-nigh impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to infer them merely from the study of the more developed
religions.</p>

<p>The study which we are undertaking is therefore a way of
taking up again, <i>but under new conditions</i>, the old problem of the
origin of religion. To be sure, if by origin we are to understand
the very first beginning, the question has nothing scientific about
it, and should be resolutely discarded. There was no given
moment when religion began to exist, and there is consequently
no need of finding a means of transporting ourselves thither in
thought. Like every human institution, religion did not commence
anywhere. Therefore, all speculations of this sort are justly
discredited; they can only consist in subjective and arbitrary
constructions which are subject to no sort of control. But the
problem which we raise is quite another one. What we want to
do is to find a means of discerning the ever-present causes upon
which the most essential forms of religious thought and practice
depend. Now for the reasons which were just set forth, these
causes are proportionately more easily observable as the societies
where they are observed are less complicated. That is why we
try to get as near as possible to the origins.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is not that we
ascribe particular virtues to the lower religions. On the contrary,
they are rudimentary and gross; we cannot make of them a sort
of model which later religions only have to reproduce. But even
their grossness makes them instructive, for they thus become
convenient for experiments, as in them, the facts and their
relations are easily seen. In order to discover the laws of the
phenomena which he studies, the physicist tries to simplify these
latter and rid them of their secondary characteristics. For that
which concerns institutions, nature spontaneously makes the
same sort of simplifications at the beginning of history. We
merely wish to put these to profit. Undoubtedly we can only
touch very elementary facts by this method. When we shall
have accounted for them as far as possible, the novelties of every
sort which have been produced in the course of evolution will
not yet be explained. But while we do not dream of denying the
importance of the problems thus raised, we think that they will
profit by being treated in their turn, and that it is important to
take them up only after those of which we are going to undertake
the study at present.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>But our study is not of interest merely for the science of
religion. In fact, every religion has one side by which it overlaps
the circle of properly religious ideas, and there, the study
of religious phenomena gives a means of renewing the problems
which, up to the present, have only been discussed among
philosophers.</p>

<p>For a long time it has been known that the first systems of
representations with which men have pictured to themselves the
world and themselves were of religious origin. There is no religion
that is not a cosmology at the same time that it is a speculation
upon divine things. If philosophy and the sciences were born
of religion, it is because religion began by taking the place of
the sciences and philosophy. But it has been less frequently
noticed that religion has not confined itself to enriching the
human intellect, formed beforehand, with a certain number
of ideas; it has contributed to forming the intellect itself. Men
owe to it not only a good part of the substance of their
knowledge, but also the form in which this knowledge has been
elaborated.</p>

<p>At the roots of all our judgments there are a certain number of
essential ideas which dominate all our intellectual life; they are
what philosophers since Aristotle have called the categories of
the understanding: ideas of time, space,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> class, number, cause,
substance, personality, etc. They correspond to the most universal
properties of things. They are like the solid frame which
encloses all thought; this does not seem to be able to liberate
itself from them without destroying itself, for it seems that we
cannot think of objects that are not in time and space, which
have no number, etc. Other ideas are contingent and unsteady;
we can conceive of their being unknown to a man, a society or
an epoch; but these others appear to be nearly inseparable from
the normal working of the intellect. They are like the framework
of the intelligence. Now when primitive religious beliefs are
systematically analysed, the principal categories are naturally
found. They are born in religion and of religion; they are
a product of religious thought. This is a statement that we
are going to have occasion to make many times in the course
of this work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>This remark has some interest of itself already; but here is
what gives it its real importance.</p>

<p>The general conclusion of the book which the reader has before
him is that religion is something eminently social. Religious
representations are collective representations which express
collective realities; the rites are a manner of acting which take
rise in the midst of the assembled groups and which are destined
to excite, maintain or recreate certain mental states in these
groups. So if the categories are of religious origin, they ought to
participate in this nature common to all religious facts; they too
should be social affairs and the product of collective thought. At
least&mdash;for in the actual condition of our knowledge of these matters,
one should be careful to avoid all radical and exclusive statements&mdash;it
is allowable to suppose that they are rich in social elements.</p>

<p>Even at present, these can be imperfectly seen in some of them.
For example, try to represent what the notion of time would be
without the processes by which we divide it, measure it or express
it with objective signs, a time which is not a succession of years,
months, weeks, days and hours! This is something nearly unthinkable.
We cannot conceive of time, except on condition of
distinguishing its different moments. Now what is the origin of
this differentiation? Undoubtedly, the states of consciousness
which we have already experienced can be reproduced in us in
the same order in which they passed in the first place; thus
portions of our past become present again, though being clearly
distinguished from the present. But howsoever important this
distinction may be for our private experience, it is far from being
enough to constitute the notion or category of time. This does
not consist merely in a commemoration, either partial or integral,
of our past life. It is an abstract and impersonal frame which
surrounds, not only our individual existence, but that of all
humanity. It is like an endless chart, where all duration is spread
out before the mind, and upon which all possible events can be
located in relation to fixed and determined guide lines. It is not
<i>my time</i> that is thus arranged; it is time in general, such as it is
objectively thought of by everybody in a single civilization. That
alone is enough to give us a hint that such an arrangement ought
to be collective. And in reality, observation proves that these
indispensable guide lines, in relation to which all things are
temporally located, are taken from social life. The divisions into
days, weeks, months, years, etc., correspond to the periodical
recurrence of rites, feasts, and public ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A calendar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
expresses the rhythm of the collective activities, while at the same
time its function is to assure their regularity.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is the same thing with space. As Hamelin has shown,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
space is not the vague and indetermined medium which Kant
imagined; if purely and absolutely homogeneous, it would be
of no use, and could not be grasped by the mind. Spatial
representation consists essentially in a primary co-ordination
of the data of sensuous experience. But this co-ordination would
be impossible if the parts of space were qualitatively equivalent
and if they were really interchangeable. To dispose things
spatially there must be a possibility of placing them differently, of
putting some at the right, others at the left, these above, those
below, at the north of or at the south of, east or west of, etc., etc.,
just as to dispose states of consciousness temporally there must
be a possibility of localizing them at determined dates. That
is to say that space could not be what it is if it were not, like
time, divided and differentiated. But whence come these
divisions which are so essential? By themselves, there are
neither right nor left, up nor down, north nor south, etc. All
these distinctions evidently come from the fact that different
sympathetic values have been attributed to various regions. Since
all the men of a single civilization represent space in the same way,
it is clearly necessary that these sympathetic values, and the
distinctions which depend upon them, should be equally universal,
and that almost necessarily implies that they be of social origin.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Besides that, there are cases where this social character is
made manifest. There are societies in Australia and North
America where space is conceived in the form of an immense
circle, because the camp has a circular form;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and this spatial
circle is divided up exactly like the tribal circle, and is in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
image. There are as many regions distinguished as there are
clans in the tribe, and it is the place occupied by the clans inside
the encampment which has determined the orientation of these
regions. Each region is defined by the totem of the clan to which
it is assigned. Among the Zu&ntilde;i, for example, the pueblo contains
seven quarters; each of these is a group of clans which has had
a unity: in all probability it was originally a single clan which
was later subdivided. Now their space also contains seven
quarters, and each of these seven quarters of the world is in
intimate connection with a quarter of the pueblo, that is to say
with a group of clans.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "Thus," says Cushing, "one division
is thought to be in relation with the north, another represents
the west, another the south," etc.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Each quarter of the pueblo
has its characteristic colour, which symbolizes it; each region
has its colour, which is exactly the same as that of the corresponding
quarter. In the course of history the number of
fundamental clans has varied; the number of the fundamental
regions of space has varied with them. Thus the social organization
has been the model for the spatial organization and a reproduction
of it. It is thus even up to the distinction between
right and left which, far from being inherent in the nature of
man in general, is very probably the product of representations
which are religious and therefore collective.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Analogous proofs will be found presently in regard to the ideas
of class, force, personality and efficacy. It is even possible to
ask if the idea of contradiction does not also depend upon social
conditions. What makes one tend to believe this is that the
empire which the idea has exercised over human thought has
varied with times and societies. To-day the principle of identity
dominates scientific thought; but there are vast systems of
representations which have played a considerable r&ocirc;le in the
history of ideas where it has frequently been set aside: these
are the mythologies, from the grossest up to the most reasonable.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
There, we are continually coming upon beings which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have the most contradictory attributes simultaneously, who are
at the same time one and many, material and spiritual, who can
divide themselves up indefinitely without losing anything of
their constitution; in mythology it is an axiom that the part
is worth the whole. These variations through which the rules
which seem to govern our present logic have passed prove that,
far from being engraven through all eternity upon the mental
constitution of men, they depend, at least in part, upon factors
that are historical and consequently social. We do not know
exactly what they are, but we may presume that they exist.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<p class="npara">This hypothesis once admitted, the problem of knowledge is
posed in new terms.</p>

<p>Up to the present there have been only two doctrines in the
field. For some, the categories cannot be derived from experience:
they are logically prior to it and condition it. They are represented
as so many simple and irreducible data, imminent in the
human mind by virtue of its inborn constitution. For this reason
they are said to be <i>a priori</i>. Others, however, hold that they are
constructed and made up of pieces and bits, and that the individual
is the artisan of this construction.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But each solution raises grave difficulties.</p>

<p>Is the empirical thesis the one adopted? Then it is necessary
to deprive the categories of all their characteristic properties.
As a matter of fact they are distinguished from all other knowledge
by their universality and necessity. They are the most
general concepts which exist, because they are applicable to all
that is real, and since they are not attached to any particular
object they are independent of every particular subject; they
constitute the common field where all minds meet. Further,
they must meet there, for reason, which is nothing more than
all the fundamental categories taken together, is invested with
an authority which we could not set aside if we would. When
we attempt to revolt against it, and to free ourselves from some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of these essential ideas, we meet with great resistances. They
do not merely depend upon us, but they impose themselves
upon us. Now empirical data present characteristics which are
diametrically opposed to these. A sensation or an image always
relies upon a determined object, or upon a collection of objects
of the same sort, and expresses the momentary condition of a
particular consciousness; it is essentially individual and subjective.
We therefore have considerable liberty in dealing with
the representations of such an origin. It is true that when our
sensations are actual, they impose themselves upon us <i>in fact</i>.
But <i>by right</i> we are free to conceive them otherwise than they
really are, or to represent them to ourselves as occurring in a
different order from that where they are really produced. In
regard to them nothing is forced upon us except as considerations
of another sort intervene. Thus we find that we have here two
sorts of knowledge, which are like the two opposite poles of the
intelligence. Under these conditions forcing reason back upon
experience causes it to disappear, for it is equivalent to reducing
the universality and necessity which characterize it to pure
appearance, to an illusion which may be useful practically, but
which corresponds to nothing in reality; consequently it is
denying all objective reality to the logical life, whose regulation
and organization is the function of the categories. Classical
empiricism results in irrationalism; perhaps it would even be
fitting to designate it by this latter name.</p>

<p>In spite of the sense ordinarily attached to the name, the
apriorists have more respect for the facts. Since they do not
admit it as a truth established by evidence that the categories
are made up of the same elements as our sensual representations,
they are not obliged to impoverish them systematically, to draw
from them all their real content, and to reduce them to nothing
more than verbal artifices. On the contrary, they leave them all
their specific characteristics. The apriorists are the rationalists;
they believe that the world has a logical aspect which the reason
expresses excellently. But for all that, it is necessary for them
to give the mind a certain power of transcending experience and
of adding to that which is given to it directly; and of this singular
power they give neither explanation nor justification.
For it is no explanation to say that it is inherent in the nature of
the human intellect. It is necessary to show whence we hold
this surprising prerogative and how it comes that we can see
certain relations in things which the examination of these things
cannot reveal to us. Saying that only on this condition is
experience itself possible changes the problem perhaps, but does
not answer it. For the real question is to know how it comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
that experience is not sufficient unto itself, but presupposes
certain conditions which are exterior and prior to it, and how
it happens that these conditions are realized at the moment and
in the manner that is desirable. To answer these questions it
has sometimes been assumed that above the reason of individuals
there is a superior and perfect reason from which the others
emanate and from which they get this marvellous power of theirs,
by a sort of mystic participation: this is the divine reason.
But this hypothesis has at least the one grave disadvantage of
being deprived of all experimental control; thus it does not
satisfy the conditions demanded of a scientific hypothesis.
More than that, the categories of human thought are never fixed
in any one definite form; they are made, unmade and remade
incessantly; they change with places and times. On the other
hand, the divine reason is immutable. How can this immutability
give rise to this incessant variability?</p>

<p>Such are the two conceptions that have been pitted against
each other for centuries; and if this debate seems to be eternal,
it is because the arguments given are really about equivalent.
If reason is only a form of individual experience, it no longer
exists. On the other hand, if the powers which it has are recognized
but not accounted for, it seems to be set outside the confines
of nature and science. In the face of these two opposed
objections the mind remains uncertain. But if the social origin
of the categories is admitted, a new attitude becomes possible,
which we believe will enable us to escape both of the opposed
difficulties.</p>

<p>The fundamental proposition of the apriorist theory is that
knowledge is made up of two sorts of elements, which cannot
be reduced into one another, and which are like two distinct
layers superimposed one upon the other.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Our hypothesis keeps
this principle intact. In fact, that knowledge which is called
empirical, the only knowledge of which the theorists of empiricism
have made use in constructing the reason, is that which is brought
into our minds by the direct action of objects. It is composed
of individual states which are completely explained<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> by the
psychical nature of the individual. If, on the other hand, the
categories are, as we believe they are, essentially collective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
representations, before all else, they should show the mental
states of the group; they should depend upon the way in which
this is founded and organized, upon its morphology, upon its
religious, moral and economic institutions, etc. So between these
two sorts of representations there is all the difference which
exists between the individual and the social, and one can no
more derive the second from the first than he can deduce society
from the individual, the whole from the part, the complex from
the simple.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Society is a reality <i>sui generis</i>; it has its own
peculiar characteristics, which are not found elsewhere and
which are not met with again in the same form in all the rest of
the universe. The representations which express it have a wholly
different contents from purely individual ones and we may rest
assured in advance that the first add something to the second.</p>

<p>Even the manner in which the two are formed results in differentiating
them. Collective representations are the result of
an immense co-operation, which stretches out not only into space
but into time as well; to make them, a multitude of minds have
associated, united and combined their ideas and sentiments;
for them, long generations have accumulated their experience
and their knowledge. A special intellectual activity is therefore
concentrated in them which is infinitely richer and complexer
than that of the individual. From that one can understand how
the reason has been able to go beyond the limits of empirical
knowledge. It does not owe this to any vague mysterious virtue
but simply to the fact that according to the well-known formula,
man is double. There are two beings in him: an individual
being which has its foundation in the organism and the circle of
whose activities is therefore strictly limited, and a social being
which represents the highest reality in the intellectual and
moral order that we can know by observation&mdash;I mean society.
This duality of our nature has as its consequence in the practical
order, the irreducibility of a moral ideal to a utilitarian motive,
and in the order of thought, the irreducibility of reason to
individual experience. In so far as he belongs to society, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
individual transcends himself, both when he thinks and when
he acts.</p>

<p>This same social character leads to an understanding of the
origin of the necessity of the categories. It is said that an idea
is necessary when it imposes itself upon the mind by some sort
of virtue of its own, without being accompanied by any proof.
It contains within it something which constrains the intelligence
and which leads to its acceptance without preliminary examination.
The apriorist postulates this singular quality, but does not
account for it; for saying that the categories are necessary
because they are indispensable to the functioning of the intellect
is simply repeating that they are necessary. But if they really
have the origin which we attribute to them, their ascendancy no
longer has anything surprising in it. They represent the most
general relations which exist between things; surpassing all
our other ideas in extension, they dominate all the details of
our intellectual life. If men did not agree upon these essential
ideas at every moment, if they did not have the same conception
of time, space, cause, number, etc., all contact between their
minds would be impossible, and with that, all life together.
Thus society could not abandon the categories to the free choice
of the individual without abandoning itself. If it is to live there
is not merely need of a satisfactory moral conformity, but also
there is a minimum of logical conformity beyond which it cannot
safely go. For this reason it uses all its authority upon its
members to forestall such dissidences. Does a mind ostensibly
free itself from these forms of thought? It is no longer considered
a human mind in the full sense of the word, and is treated accordingly.
That is why we feel that we are no longer completely free
and that something resists, both within and outside ourselves,
when we attempt to rid ourselves of these fundamental notions,
even in our own conscience. Outside of us there is public opinion
which judges us; but more than that, since society is also represented
inside of us, it sets itself against these revolutionary
fancies, even inside of ourselves; we have the feeling that we
cannot abandon them if our whole thought is not to cease being
really human. This seems to be the origin of the exceptional
authority which is inherent in the reason and which makes us
accept its suggestions with confidence. It is the very authority
of society,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> transferring itself to a certain manner of thought
which is the indispensable condition of all common action. The
necessity with which the categories are imposed upon us is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the effect of simple habits whose yoke we could easily throw off
with a little effort; nor is it a physical or metaphysical necessity,
since the categories change in different places and times; it is
a special sort of moral necessity which is to the intellectual life
what moral obligation is to the will.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>


<p class="npara">But if the categories originally only translate social states,
does it not follow that they can be applied to the rest of nature
only as metaphors? If they were made merely to express
social conditions, it seems as though they could not be extended
to other realms except in this sense. Thus in so far as they aid
us in thinking of the physical or biological world, they have only
the value of artificial symbols, useful practically perhaps, but
having no connection with reality. Thus we come back, by a
different road, to nominalism and empiricism.</p>

<p>But when we interpret a sociological theory of knowledge in
this way, we forget that even if society is a specific reality it is
not an empire within an empire; it is a part of nature, and indeed
its highest representation. The social realm is a natural
realm which differs from the others only by a greater complexity.
Now it is impossible that nature should differ radically from
itself in the one case and the other in regard to that which is
most essential. The fundamental relations that exist between
things&mdash;just that which it is the function of the categories to
express&mdash;cannot be essentially dissimilar in the different realms.
If, for reasons which we shall discuss later,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> they are more clearly
disengaged in the social world, it is nevertheless impossible that
they should not be found elsewhere, though in less pronounced
forms. Society makes them more manifest but it does not have
a monopoly upon them. That is why ideas which have been
elaborated on the model of social things can aid us in thinking
of another department of nature. It is at least true that if these
ideas play the r&ocirc;le of symbols when they are thus turned aside
from their original signification, they are well-founded symbols.
If a sort of artificiality enters into them from the mere fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they are constructed concepts, it is an artificiality which follows
nature very closely and which is constantly approaching it still
more closely.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> From the fact that the ideas of time, space, class,
cause or personality are constructed out of social elements, it is
not necessary to conclude that they are devoid of all objective
value. On the contrary, their social origin rather leads to the
belief that they are not without foundation in the nature of
things.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Thus renovated, the theory of knowledge seems destined to
unite the opposing advantages of the two rival theories, without
incurring their inconveniences. It keeps all the essential principles
of the apriorists; but at the same time it is inspired by
that positive spirit which the empiricists have striven to satisfy.
It leaves the reason its specific power, but it accounts for it and
does so without leaving the world of observable phenomena.
It affirms the duality of our intellectual life, but it explains it,
and with natural causes. The categories are no longer considered
as primary and unanalysable facts, yet they keep a
complexity which falsifies any analysis as ready as that with
which the empiricists content themselves. They no longer appear
as very simple notions which the first comer can very easily
arrange from his own personal observations and which the
popular imagination has unluckily complicated, but rather they
appear as priceless instruments of thought which the human
groups have laboriously forged through the centuries and where
they have accumulated the best of their intellectual capital.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
A complete section of the history of humanity is resumed therein.
This is equivalent to saying that to succeed in understanding
them and judging them, it is necessary to resort to other means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
than those which have been in use up to the present. To know
what these conceptions which we have not made ourselves are
really made of, it does not suffice to interrogate our own consciousnesses;
we must look outside of ourselves, it is history
that we must observe, there is a whole science which must be
formed, a complex science which can advance but slowly and by
collective labour, and to which the present work brings some
fragmentary contributions in the nature of an attempt. Without
making these questions the direct object of our study, we shall
profit by all the occasions which present themselves to us of
catching at their very birth some at least of these ideas which,
while being of religious origin, still remain at the foundation of
the human intelligence.</p>

<small>DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA AND OF RELIGION<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></small></h3>


<p>If we are going to look for the most primitive and simple
religion which we can observe, it is necessary to begin by
defining what is meant by a religion; for without this, we would
run the risk of giving the name to a system of ideas and practices
which has nothing at all religious about it, or else of leaving
to one side many religious facts, without perceiving their true
nature. That this is not an imaginary danger, and that nothing
is thus sacrificed to a vain formalism of method, is well shown
by the fact that owing to his not having taken this precaution,
a certain scholar to whom the science of comparative religions
owes a great deal, Professor Frazer, has not been able to recognize
the profoundly religious character of the beliefs and rites
which will be studied below, where, according to our view, the
initial germ of the religious life of humanity is to be found.
So this is a prejudicial question, which must be treated before
all others. It is not that we dream of arriving at once at the
profound characteristics which really explain religion: these
can be determined only at the end of our study. But that which
is necessary and possible, is to indicate a certain number of
external and easily recognizable signs, which will enable us to
recognize religious phenomena wherever they are met with, and
which will deter us from confounding them with others. We shall
proceed to this preliminary operation at once.</p>

<p>But to attain the desired results, it is necessary to begin by
freeing the mind of every preconceived idea. Men have been
obliged to make for themselves a notion of what religion is,
long before the science of religions started its methodical comparisons.
The necessities of existence force all of us, believers
and non-believers, to represent in some way these things in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the midst of which we live, upon which we must pass judgment
constantly, and which we must take into account in all our
conduct. However, since these preconceived ideas are formed
without any method, according to the circumstances and chances
of life, they have no right to any credit whatsoever, and must
be rigorously set aside in the examination which is to follow.
It is not from our prejudices, passions or habits that we should
demand the elements of the definition which we must have;
it is from the reality itself which we are going to define.</p>

<p>Let us set ourselves before this reality. Leaving aside all conceptions
of religion in general, let us consider the various religions
in their concrete reality, and attempt to disengage that
which they have in common; for religion cannot be defined
except by the characteristics which are found wherever religion
itself is found. In this comparison, then, we shall make use of
all the religious systems which we can know, those of the present
and those of the past, the most primitive and simple as well as
the most recent and refined; for we have neither the right nor
the logical means of excluding some and retaining others. For
those who regard religion as only a natural manifestation of
human activity, all religions, without any exception whatsoever,
are instructive; for all, after their manner, express man, and
thus can aid us in better understanding this aspect of our nature.
Also, we have seen how far it is from being the best way of studying
religion to consider by preference the forms which it presents
among the most civilized peoples.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>But to aid the mind in freeing itself from these usual conceptions
which, owing to their prestige, might prevent it from
seeing things as they really are, it is fitting to examine some of
the most current of the definitions in which these prejudices
are commonly expressed, before taking up the question on our
own account.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>One idea which generally passes as characteristic of all that
is religious, is that of the supernatural. By this is understood
all sorts of things which surpass the limits of our knowledge;
the supernatural is the world of the mysterious, of the unknowable,
of the un-understandable. Thus religion would be a sort
of speculation upon all that which evades science or distinct
thought in general. "Religions diametrically opposed in their
overt dogmas," said Spencer, "are perfectly at one in the tacit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
conviction that the existence of the world, with all it contains
and all which surrounds it, is a mystery calling for an explanation";
he thus makes them consist essentially in "the belief
in the omnipresence of something which is inscrutable."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In
the same manner, Max M&uuml;ller sees in religion "a struggle to
conceive the inconceivable, to utter the unutterable, a longing
after the Infinite."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It is certain that the sentiment of mystery has not been without
a considerable importance in certain religions, notably in Christianity.
It must also be said that the importance of this sentiment
has varied remarkably at different moments in the history
of Christianity. There are periods when this notion passes to an
inferior place, and is even effaced. For example, for the Christians
of the seventeenth century, dogma had nothing disturbing for
the reason; faith reconciled itself easily with science and
philosophy, and the thinkers, such as Pascal, who really felt that
there is something profoundly obscure in things, were so little in
harmony with their age that they remained misunderstood by
their contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It would appear somewhat hasty, therefore,
to make an idea subject to parallel eclipses, the essential
element of even the Christian religion.</p>

<p>In all events, it is certain that this idea does not appear until
late in the history of religions; it is completely foreign, not only
to those peoples who are called primitive, but also to all others
who have not attained a considerable degree of intellectual
culture. When we see them attribute extraordinary virtues to
insignificant objects, and people the universe with singular
principles, made up of the most diverse elements and endowed
with a sort of ubiquity which is hardly representable, we are
undoubtedly prone to find an air of mystery in these conceptions.
It seems to us that these men would have been willing to resign
themselves to these ideas, so disturbing for our modern reason,
only because of their inability to find others which were more
rational. But, as a matter of fact, these explanations which
surprise us so much, appear to the primitive man as the simplest
in the world. He does not regard them as a sort of <i>ultima ratio</i>
to which the intellect resigns itself only in despair of others, but
rather as the most obvious manner of representing and understanding
what he sees about him. For him there is nothing strange
in the fact that by a mere word or gesture one is able to command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the elements, retard or precipitate the motion of the stars, bring
rain or cause it to cease, etc. The rites which he employs to assure
the fertility of the soil or the fecundity of the animal species on
which he is nourished do not appear more irrational to his eyes
than the technical processes of which our agriculturists make
use, for the same object, do to ours. The powers which he puts
into play by these diverse means do not seem to him to have
anything especially mysterious about them. Undoubtedly these
forces are different from those which the modern scientist thinks
of, and whose use he teaches us; they have a different way of
acting, and do not allow themselves to be directed in the same
manner; but for those who believe in them, they are no more
unintelligible than are gravitation and electricity for the
physicist of to-day. Moreover, we shall see, in the course of this
work, that the idea of physical forces is very probably derived
from that of religious forces; then there cannot exist between
the two the abyss which separates the rational from the irrational.
Even the fact that religious forces are frequently conceived under
the form of spiritual beings or conscious wills, is no proof of their
irrationality. The reason has no repugnance <i>a priori</i> to admitting
that the so-called inanimate bodies should be directed by
intelligences, just as the human body is, though contemporary
science accommodates itself with difficulty to this hypothesis.
When Leibniz proposed to conceive the external world as an
immense society of minds, between which there were, and could
be, only spiritual relations, he thought he was working as a
rationalist, and saw nothing in this universal animism which
could be offensive to the intellect.</p>

<p>Moreover, the idea of the supernatural, as we understand it,
dates only from to-day; in fact, it presupposes the contrary idea,
of which it is the negation; but this idea is not at all primitive.
In order to say that certain things are supernatural, it is necessary
to have the sentiment that a <i>natural order of things</i> exists, that is
to say, that the phenomena of the universe are bound together
by necessary relations, called laws. When this principle has once
been admitted, all that is contrary to these laws must necessarily
appear to be outside of nature, and consequently, of reason; for
what is natural in this sense of the word, is also rational, these
necessary relations only expressing the manner in which things
are logically related. But this idea of universal determinism is
of recent origin; even the greatest thinkers of classical antiquity
never succeeded in becoming fully conscious of it. It is a conquest
of the positive sciences; it is the postulate upon which they
repose and which they have proved by their progress. Now as
long as this was lacking or insufficiently established, the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
marvellous events contained nothing which did not appear
perfectly conceivable. So long as men did not know the immutability
and the inflexibility of the order of things, and so
long as they saw there the work of contingent wills, they found
it natural that either these wills or others could modify them
arbitrarily. That is why the miraculous interventions which
the ancients attributed to their gods were not to their eyes
miracles in the modern acceptation of the term. For them,
they were beautiful, rare or terrible spectacles, or causes of
surprise and marvel (&#952;&#945;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, <i>mirabilia</i>, <i>miracula</i>); but they
never saw in them glimpses of a mysterious world into which the
reason cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>We can understand this mentality the better since it has not
yet completely disappeared from our midst. If the principle of
determinism is solidly established to-day in the physical and
natural sciences, it is only a century ago that it was first introduced
into the social sciences, and its authority there is still
contested. There are only a small number of minds which are
strongly penetrated with this idea that societies are subject to
natural laws and form a kingdom of nature. It follows that
veritable miracles are believed to be possible there. It is admitted,
for example, that a legislator can create an institution
out of nothing by a mere injunction of its will, or transform one
social system into another, just as the believers in so many
religions have held that the divine will created the world out of
nothing, or can arbitrarily transmute one thing into another. As
far as social facts are concerned, we still have the mentality of
primitives. However, if so many of our contemporaries still
retain this antiquated conception for sociological affairs, it is not
because the life of societies appears obscure and mysterious to
them; on the contrary, if they are so easily contented with these
explanations, and if they are so obstinate in their illusions which
experience constantly belies, it is because social events seem to
them the clearest thing in the world; it is because they have not
yet realized their real obscurity; it is because they have not yet
recognized the necessity of resorting to the laborious methods of
the natural sciences to gradually scatter the darkness. The same
state of mind is found at the root of many religious beliefs which
surprise us by their pseudo-simplicity. It is science and not
religion which has taught men that things are complex and
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>But the human mind, says Jevons,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has no need of a properly
scientific culture to notice that determined sequences, or a constant
order of succession, exist between facts, or to observe, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
other hand, that this order is frequently upset. It sometimes
happens that the sun is suddenly eclipsed, that rain fails at the
time when it is expected, that the moon is slow to reappear after
its periodical disappearance, etc. Since these events are outside
the ordinary course of affairs, they are attributed to extraordinary
exceptional causes, that is to say, in fine, to extra-natural causes.
It is under this form that the idea of the supernatural is born at
the very outset of history, and from this moment, according to
this author, religious thought finds itself provided with its proper
subject.</p>

<p>But in the first place, the supernatural cannot be reduced to
the unforeseen. The new is a part of nature just as well as its
contrary. If we state that in general, phenomena succeed one
another in a determined order, we observe equally well that this
order is only approximative, that it is not always precisely the
same, and that it has all kinds of exceptions. If we have ever
so little experience, we are accustomed to seeing our expectations
fail, and these deceptions return too often to appear extraordinary
to us. A certain contingency is taught by experience just as well
as a certain uniformity; then we have no reason for assigning
the one to causes and forces entirely different from those upon
which the other depends. In order to arrive at the idea of the
supernatural, it is not enough, therefore, to be witnesses to unexpected
events; it is also necessary that these be conceived as
impossible, that is to say, irreconcilable with an order which,
rightly or wrongly, appears to us to be implied in the nature of
things. Now this idea of a necessary order has been constructed
little by little by the positive sciences, and consequently the
contrary notion could not have existed before them.</p>

<p>Also, in whatever manner men have represented the novelties
and contingencies revealed by experience, there is nothing in
these representations which could serve to characterize religion.
For religious conceptions have as their object, before everything
else, to express and explain, not that which is exceptional and
abnormal in things, but, on the contrary, that which is constant
and regular. Very frequently, the gods serve less to account for
the monstrosities, fantasies and anomalies than for the regular
march of the universe, for the movement of the stars, the rhythm
of the seasons, the annual growth of vegetation, the perpetuation
of species, etc. It is far from being true, then, that the notion of
the religions coincides with that of the extraordinary or the
unforeseen. Jevons replies that this conception of religious
forces is not primitive. Men commenced by imagining them to
account for disorders and accidents, and it was only afterwards
that they began to utilize them in explaining the uniformities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
nature.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But it is not clear what could have led men to attribute
such manifestly contradictory functions to them. More than
that, the hypothesis according to which sacred beings were at
first restricted to the negative function of disturbers is quite
arbitrary. In fact, we shall see that, even with the most simple
religions we know, their essential task is to maintain, in a positive
manner, the normal course of life.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>So the idea of mystery is not of primitive origin. It was not
given to man; it is man who has forged it, with his own hands,
along with the contrary idea. This is why it has a place only in
a very small number of advanced religions. It is impossible to
make it the characteristic mark of religious phenomena without
excluding from the definition the majority of the facts to be
defined.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Another idea by which the attempt to define religion is often
made, is that of divinity. "Religion," says M. R&eacute;ville,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "is the
determination of human life by the sentiment of a bond uniting
the human mind to that mysterious mind whose domination of
the world and itself it recognizes, and to whom it delights in
feeling itself united." It is certain that if the word divinity is
taken in a precise and narrow sense, this definition leaves aside
a multitude of obviously religious facts. The souls of the dead
and the spirits of all ranks and classes with which the religious
imagination of so many different peoples has populated nature,
are always the object of rites and sometimes even of a regular
cult; yet they are not gods in the proper sense of the term. But
in order that the definition may embrace them, it is enough to
substitute for the term "gods" the more comprehensive one of
"spiritual beings." This is what Tylor does. "The first
requisite in a systematic study of the religions of the lower
races," he says, "is to lay down a rudimentary definition of
religion. By requiring in this definition the belief in a supreme
deity ..., no doubt many tribes may be excluded from the category
of religious. But such narrow definition has the fault of identifying
religion rather with particular developments.... It seems
best ... simply to claim as a minimum definition of Religion,
the belief in Spiritual Beings."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> By spiritual beings must be
understood conscious subjects gifted with powers superior to
those possessed by common men; this qualification is found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in the souls of the dead, geniuses or demons as well as in divinities
properly so-called. It is important, therefore, to give our
attention at once to the particular conception of religion which
is implied in this definition. The relations which we can have
with beings of this sort are determined by the nature attributed
to them. They are conscious beings; then we can act upon
them only in the same way that we act upon consciousnesses in
general, that is to say, by psychological processes, attempting
to convince them or move them, either with the aid of words
(invocations, prayers), or by offerings and sacrifices. And
since the object of religion is to regulate our relations with these
special beings, there can be no religion except where there are
prayers, sacrifices, propitiatory rites, etc. Thus we have a very
simple criterium which permits us to distinguish that which is
religious from that which is not. It is to this criterium that
Frazer,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and with him numerous ethnographers,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> systematically
makes reference.</p>

<p>But howsoever evident this definition may appear, thanks to
the mental habits which we owe to our religious education,
there are many facts to which it is not applicable, but which
appertain to the field of religion nevertheless.</p>

<p>In the first place, there are great religions from which the idea
of gods and spirits is absent, or at least, where it plays only a
secondary and minor r&ocirc;le. This is the case with Buddhism.
Buddhism, says Burnouf, "sets itself in opposition to Brahmanism
as a moral system without god and an atheism without
Nature."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "As it recognizes not a god upon whom man depends,"
says Barth, "its doctrine is absolutely atheistic,"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> while Oldenberg,
in his turn, calls it "a faith without a god."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In fact,
all that is essential to Buddhism is found in the four propositions
which the faithful call the four noble truths.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The first states
the existence of suffering as the accompaniment to the perpetual
change of things; the second shows desire to be the cause of
suffering; the third makes the suppression of desire the only
means of suppressing sorrow; the fourth enumerates the three
stages through which one must pass to attain this suppression:
they are uprightness, meditation, and finally wisdom, the full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
possession of the doctrine. These three stages once traversed,
one arrives at the end of the road, at the deliverance, at salvation
by the Nirv&acirc;na.</p>

<p>Now in none of these principles is there question of a divinity.
The Buddhist is not interested in knowing whence came the
world in which he lives and suffers; he takes it as a given fact,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and his whole concern is to escape it. On the other hand, in this
work of salvation, he can count only upon himself; "he has
no god to thank, as he had previously no god to invoke during
his struggle."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Instead of praying, in the ordinary sense of the
term, instead of turning towards a superior being and imploring
his assistance, he relies upon himself and meditates. This is not
saying "that he absolutely denies the existence of the beings
called Indra, Agni and Varuna;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but he believes that he owes
them nothing and that he has nothing to do with them," for
their power can only extend over the goods of this world, which
are without value for him. Then he is an atheist, in the sense
that he does not concern himself with the question whether gods
exist or not. Besides, even if they should exist, and with whatever
powers they might be armed, the saint or the emancipated
man regards himself superior to them; for that which causes
the dignity of beings is not the extent of the action they exercise
over things, but merely the degree of their advancement upon
the road of salvation.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It is true that Buddha, at least in some divisions of the Buddhist
Church, has sometimes been considered as a sort of god.
He has his temples; he is the object of a cult, which, by the
way, is a very simple one, for it is reduced essentially to the
offering of flowers and the adoration of consecrated relics or
images. It is scarcely more than a commemorative cult. But
more than that, this divinization of Buddha, granting that the
term is exact, is peculiar to the form known as Northern
Buddhism. "The Buddhist of the South," says Kern, "and
the less advanced of the Northern Buddhists can be said, according
to data known to-day, to speak of their founder as if he
were a man."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Of course, they attribute extraordinary powers
to Buddha, which are superior to those possessed by ordinary
mortals; but it was a very ancient belief in India, and one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
is also very general in a host of different religions, that a great
saint is endowed with exceptional virtues;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> yet a saint is not
a god, any more than a priest or magician is, in spite of the
superhuman faculties frequently attributed to them. On the
other hand, according to the most authorized scholars, all this
theism and the complicated mythology which generally accompanies
it, are only derived and deviated forms of Buddhism.
At first, Buddha was only regarded as "the wisest of men."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Burnouf says "the conception of a Buddha who is something
more than a man arrived at the highest stage of holiness, is outside
the circle of ideas which form the foundation of the simple
S&ucirc;tras";<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the same author adds elsewhere that "his
humanity is a fact so incontestably recognized by all that the
myth-makers, to whom miracles cost so little, have never even
had the idea of making a god out of him since his death."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
So we may well ask if he has ever really divested himself completely
of all human character, and if we have a right to make
him into a god completely;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in any case, it would have to be
a god of a very particular character and one whose r&ocirc;le in no
way resembles that of other divine personalities. For a god is
before all else a living being, with whom man should reckon,
and upon whom he may count; but Buddha is dead, he has
entered into the Nirv&acirc;na, and he can no longer influence the
march of human events.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Finally, whatever one may think of the divinity of Buddha,
it remains a fact that this is a conception wholly outside the
essential part of Buddhism. Buddhism consists primarily in
the idea of salvation, and salvation supposes only that one know
the good doctrine and practise it. To be sure, this could never
have been known if Buddha had not come to reveal it; but
when this revelation had once been made, the work of Buddha
was accomplished. From that moment he ceased to be a factor
necessary to the religious life. The practice of the four holy
truths would be possible, even if the memory of him who revealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
them were completely obliterated.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It is quite another matter
with Christianity, which is inconceivable without the ever-present
idea of Christ and his ever-practised cult; for it is by
the ever-living Christ, sacrificed each day, that the community
of believers continues to communicate with the supreme source
of the spiritual life.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>All that precedes can be applied equally well to another great
religion of India, Ja&iuml;nism. The two doctrines have nearly the
same conception of the world and of life. "Like the Buddhists,"
says Barth, "the Ja&iuml;nas are atheists. They admit of no creator;
the world is eternal; they explicitly deny the possibility of
a perfect being from the beginning. The Jina became perfect;
he was not always so."</p>

<p>Just as the Buddhists in the north, the Ja&iuml;nists, or at least
certain of them, have come back to a sort of deism; in the
inscriptions of Dekhan there is mention of a <i>Jinapati</i>, a sort of
supreme Jina, who is called the primary creator; but such
language, says the same author, is "in contradiction to the
most explicit declarations extracted from their most authorized
writings."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, if this indifference for the divine is developed to
such a point in Buddhism and Ja&iuml;nism, it is because its germ
existed already in the Brahmanism from which the two were
derived. In certain of its forms at least, Brahmic speculation
ended in "a frankly materialistic and atheistic interpretation
of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In time, the numerous divinities which the
people of India had originally learned to adore, came to merge
themselves into a sort of principal deity, impersonal and abstract,
the essence of all that exists. This supreme reality, which no
longer has anything of a divine personality about it, is contained
within man himself, or rather, man is but one with it, for nothing
exists apart from it. To find it, and unite himself to it, one does
not have to search some external support outside himself; it is
enough to concentrate upon himself and meditate. "If in
Buddhism," says Oldenberg, "the proud attempt be made to
conceive a deliverance in which man himself delivers himself,
to create a faith without a god, it is Brahmanical speculation
which has prepared the way for this thought. It thrusts back
the idea of a god step by step; the forms of the old gods have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
faded away, and besides the Brahma, which is enthroned in its
everlasting quietude, highly exalted above the destinies of the
human world, there is left remaining, as the sole really active
person in the great work of deliverance, man himself."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Here,
then, we find a considerable portion of religious evolution which
has consisted in the progressive recoil of the idea of a spiritual
being from that of a deity. Here are great religions where
invocations, propitiations, sacrifices and prayers properly so-called
are far from holding a preponderating place, and which
consequently do not present that distinctive sign by which some
claim to recognize those manifestations which are properly
called religious.</p>

<p>But even within deistic religions there are many rites which
are completely independent of all idea of gods or spiritual beings.
In the first place, there are a multitude of interdictions. For
example, the Bible orders that a woman live isolated during a
determined period each month;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> a similar isolation is obligatory
during the lying-in at child-birth;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> it is forbidden to hitch an
ass and a horse together, or to wear a garment in which the
hemp is mixed with flax;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but it is impossible to see the part
which belief in Jahveh can have played in these interdictions,
for he is wholly absent from all the relations thus forbidden,
and could not be interested in them. As much can be said for
the majority of the dietetic regulations. These prohibitions are
not peculiar to the Hebrews, but they are found under diverse
forms, but with substantially the same character, in innumerable
religions.</p>

<p>It is true that these rites are purely negative, but they do not
cease being religious for that. Also there are others which
demand active and positive services of the faithful, but which
are nevertheless of the same nature. They work by themselves,
and their efficacy depends upon no divine power; they mechanically
produce the effects which are the reason for their existence.
They do not consist either in prayers or offerings addressed to
a being upon whose goodwill the expected result depends;
this result is obtained by the automatic operation of the ritual.
Such is notably the case with the sacrifice of the Vedic religion.
"The sacrifice exercises a direct influence upon the celestial
phenomena," says Bergaigne;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> it is all-powerful of itself, and
without any divine influence. It is this, for example, which
broke open the doors of the cavern where the dawn was imprisoned
and which made the light of day burst forth.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
same way there are special hymns which, by their direct action,
made the waters of heaven fall upon the earth, and <i>even in
spite of the gods</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The practice of certain austerities has the
same power. More than that, "the sacrifice is so fully the origin
of things <i>par excellence</i>, that they have attributed to it not only
the origin of man, but even that of the gods.... Such a conception
may well appear strange. It is explained, however, as
being one of the ultimate consequences of the idea of the omnipotence
of sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Thus, in the entire first part of his work,
M. Bergaigne speaks only of sacrifices, where divinities play no
r&ocirc;le whatsoever.</p>

<p>Nor is this fact peculiar to the Vedic religion, but is, on the
contrary, quite general. In every cult there are practices which
act by themselves, by a virtue which is their own, without the
intervention of any god between the individual who practises
the rite and the end sought after. When, in the so-called Feast
of the Tabernacles, the Jew set the air in motion by shaking
willow branches in a certain rhythm, it was to cause the wind
to rise and the rain to fall; and it was believed that the desired
phenomenon would result automatically from the rite, provided
it were correctly performed.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This is the explanation of the
fundamental importance laid by nearly all cults upon the material
portion of the ceremonies. This religious formalism&mdash;very
probably the first form of legal formalism&mdash;comes from the fact
that since the formula to be pronounced and the movements
to be made contain within themselves the source of their efficacy,
they would lose it if they did not conform absolutely to the
type consecrated by success.</p>

<p>Thus there are rites without gods, and even rites from which
gods are derived. All religious powers do not emanate from
divine personalities, and there are relations of cult which have
other objects than uniting man to a deity. Religion is more
than the idea of gods or spirits, and consequently cannot be
defined exclusively in relation to these latter.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>These definitions set aside, let us set ourselves before the
problem.</p>

<p>First of all, let us remark that in all these formul&aelig; it is the
nature of religion as a whole that they seek to express. They
proceed as if it were a sort of indivisible entity, while, as a matter
of fact, it is made up of parts; it is a more or less complex
system of myths, dogmas, rites and ceremonies. Now a whole
cannot be defined except in relation to its parts. It will be
more methodical, then, to try to characterize the various
elementary phenomena of which all religions are made up,
before we attack the system produced by their union. This
method is imposed still more forcibly by the fact that there are
religious phenomena which belong to no determined religion.
Such are those phenomena which constitute the matter of folk-lore.
In general, they are the debris of passed religions, inorganized
survivals; but there are some which have been
formed spontaneously under the influence of local causes. In
our European countries Christianity has forced itself to absorb
and assimilate them; it has given them a Christian colouring.
Nevertheless, there are many which have persisted up until a
recent date, or which still exist with a relative autonomy:
celebrations of May Day, the summer solstice or the carnival,
beliefs relative to genii, local demons, etc., are cases in point.
If the religious character of these facts is now diminishing,
their religious importance is nevertheless so great that they have
enabled Mannhardt and his school to revive the science of
religions. A definition which did not take account of them
would not cover all that is religious.</p>

<p>Religious phenomena are naturally arranged in two fundamental
categories: beliefs and rites. The first are states of
opinion, and consist in representations; the second are determined
modes of action. Between these two classes of facts there
is all the difference which separates thought from action.</p>

<p>The rites can be defined and distinguished from other human
practices, moral practices, for example, only by the special
nature of their object. A moral rule prescribes certain manners
of acting to us, just as a rite does, but which are addressed to
a different class of objects. So it is the object of the rite which
must be characterized, if we are to characterize the rite itself.
Now it is in the beliefs that the special nature of this object is
expressed. It is possible to define the rite only after we have
defined the belief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>All known religious beliefs, whether simple or complex, present
one common characteristic: they presuppose a classification of
all the things, real and ideal, of which men think, into two classes
or opposed groups, generally designated by two distinct terms
which are translated well enough by the words <i>profane</i> and <i>sacred</i>
(<i>profane</i>, <i>sacr&eacute;</i>). This division of the world into two domains,
the one containing all that is sacred, the other all that is profane,
is the distinctive trait of religious thought; the beliefs, myths,
dogmas and legends are either representations or systems of
representations which express the nature of sacred things, the
virtues and powers which are attributed to them, or their
relations with each other and with profane things. But by
sacred things one must not understand simply those personal
beings which are called gods or spirits; a rock, a tree, a spring,
a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be
sacred. A rite can have this character; in fact, the rite does
not exist which does not have it to a certain degree. There are
words, expressions and formul&aelig; which can be pronounced only
by the mouths of consecrated persons; there are gestures and
movements which everybody cannot perform. If the Vedic
sacrifice has had such an efficacy that, according to mythology,
it was the creator of the gods, and not merely a means of winning
their favour, it is because it possessed a virtue comparable to
that of the most sacred beings. The circle of sacred objects
cannot be determined, then, once for all. Its extent varies infinitely,
according to the different religions. That is how Buddhism
is a religion: in default of gods, it admits the existence of
sacred things, namely, the four noble truths and the practices
derived from them.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Up to the present we have confined ourselves to enumerating
a certain number of sacred things as examples: we must now
show by what general characteristics they are to be distinguished
from profane things.</p>

<p>One might be tempted, first of all, to define them by the place
they are generally assigned in the hierarchy of things. They
are naturally considered superior in dignity and power to profane
things, and particularly to man, when he is only a man and has
nothing sacred about him. One thinks of himself as occupying
an inferior and dependent position in relation to them; and surely
this conception is not without some truth. Only there is nothing
in it which is really characteristic of the sacred. It is not enough
that one thing be subordinated to another for the second to be
sacred in regard to the first. Slaves are inferior to their masters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
subjects to their king, soldiers to their leaders, the miser to his
gold, the man ambitious for power to the hands which keep it
from him; but if it is sometimes said of a man that he makes a
religion of those beings or things whose eminent value and
superiority to himself he thus recognizes, it is clear that in any
case the word is taken in a metaphorical sense, and that there
is nothing in these relations which is really religious.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it must not be lost to view that there are
sacred things of every degree, and that there are some in relation
to which a man feels himself relatively at his ease. An amulet
has a sacred character, yet the respect which it inspires is nothing
exceptional. Even before his gods, a man is not always in such
a marked state of inferiority; for it very frequently happens
that he exercises a veritable physical constraint upon them to
obtain what he desires. He beats the fetich with which he is
not contented, but only to reconcile himself with it again, if in
the end it shows itself more docile to the wishes of its adorer.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
To have rain, he throws stones into the spring or sacred lake
where the god of rain is thought to reside; he believes that by
this means he forces him to come out and show himself.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Moreover,
if it is true that man depends upon his gods, this dependence
is reciprocal. The gods also have need of man; without offerings
and sacrifices they would die. We shall even have occasion to
show that this dependence of the gods upon their worshippers is
maintained even in the most idealistic religions.</p>

<p>But if a purely hierarchic distinction is a criterium at once too
general and too imprecise, there is nothing left with which to
characterize the sacred in its relation to the profane except
their heterogeneity. However, this heterogeneity is sufficient to
characterize this classification of things and to distinguish it
from all others, because it is very particular: <i>it is absolute</i>.
In all the history of human thought there exists no other example
of two categories of things so profoundly differentiated or so
radically opposed to one another. The traditional opposition
of good and bad is nothing beside this; for the good and the bad
are only two opposed species of the same class, namely morals,
just as sickness and health are two different aspects of the same
order of facts, life, while the sacred and the profane have always
and everywhere been conceived by the human mind as two
distinct classes, as two worlds between which there is nothing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
common. The forces which play in one are not simply those
which are met with in the other, but a little stronger; they are
of a different sort. In different religions, this opposition has
been conceived in different ways. Here, to separate these two
sorts of things, it has seemed sufficient to localize them in different
parts of the physical universe; there, the first have been put into
an ideal and transcendental world, while the material world is
left in full possession of the others. But howsoever much the
forms of the contrast may vary,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> the fact of the contrast is universal.</p>

<p>This is not equivalent to saying that a being can never pass from
one of these worlds into the other: but the manner in which this
passage is effected, when it does take place, puts into relief the
essential duality of the two kingdoms. In fact, it implies a
veritable metamorphosis. This is notably demonstrated by the
initiation rites, such as they are practised by a multitude of
peoples. This initiation is a long series of ceremonies with the
object of introducing the young man into the religious life: for
the first time, he leaves the purely profane world where he
passed his first infancy, and enters into the world of sacred
things. Now this change of state is thought of, not as a simple
and regular development of pre-existent germs, but as a transformation
<i>totius substantiae</i>&mdash;of the whole being. It is said that
at this moment the young man dies, that the person that he was
ceases to exist, and that another is instantly substituted for it.
He is re-born under a new form. Appropriate ceremonies are
felt to bring about this death and re-birth, which are not understood
in a merely symbolic sense, but are taken literally.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Does
this not prove that between the profane being which he was and
the religious being which he becomes, there is a break of continuity?</p>

<p>This heterogeneity is even so complete that it frequently
degenerates into a veritable antagonism. The two worlds are
not only conceived of as separate, but as even hostile and jealous
rivals of each other. Since men cannot fully belong to one except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
on condition of leaving the other completely, they are exhorted
to withdraw themselves completely from the profane world, in
order to lead an exclusively religious life. Hence comes the
monasticism which is artificially organized outside of and apart
from the natural environment in which the ordinary man leads
the life of this world, in a different one, closed to the first, and
nearly its contrary. Hence comes the mystic asceticism whose
object is to root out from man all the attachment for the profane
world that remains in him. From that come all the forms of
religious suicide, the logical working-out of this asceticism; for
the only manner of fully escaping the profane life is, after all,
to forsake all life.</p>

<p>The opposition of these two classes manifests itself outwardly
with a visible sign by which we can easily recognize this very
special classification, wherever it exists. Since the idea of the
sacred is always and everywhere separated from the idea of the
profane in the thought of men, and since we picture a sort of
logical chasm between the two, the mind irresistibly refuses to
allow the two corresponding things to be confounded, or even to
be merely put in contact with each other; for such a promiscuity,
or even too direct a contiguity, would contradict too violently
the dissociation of these ideas in the mind. The sacred thing is
<i>par excellence</i> that which the profane should not touch, and cannot
touch with impunity. To be sure, this interdiction cannot go so
far as to make all communication between the two worlds impossible;
for if the profane could in no way enter into relations
with the sacred, this latter could be good for nothing. But, in
addition to the fact that this establishment of relations is always
a delicate operation in itself, demanding great precautions and
a more or less complicated initiation,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> it is quite impossible, unless
the profane is to lose its specific characteristics and become sacred
after a fashion and to a certain degree itself. The two classes
cannot even approach each other and keep their own nature at
the same time.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at the first criterium of religious beliefs. Undoubtedly
there are secondary species within these two fundamental
classes which, in their turn, are more or less incompatible
with each other.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But the real characteristic of religious phenomena
is that they always suppose a bipartite division of the whole
universe, known and knowable, into two classes which embrace
all that exists, but which radically exclude each other. Sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
things are those which the interdictions protect and isolate;
profane things, those to which these interdictions are applied
and which must remain at a distance from the first. Religious
beliefs are the representations which express the nature of sacred
things and the relations which they sustain, either with each
other or with profane things. Finally, rites are the rules of
conduct which prescribe how a man should comport himself in
the presence of these sacred objects.</p>

<p>When a certain number of sacred things sustain relations of
co-ordination or subordination with each other in such a way as
to form a system having a certain unity, but which is not comprised
within any other system of the same sort, the totality of
these beliefs and their corresponding rites constitutes a religion.
From this definition it is seen that a religion is not necessarily
contained within one sole and single idea, and does not proceed
from one unique principle which, though varying according to
the circumstances under which it is applied, is nevertheless at
bottom always the same: it is rather a whole made up of distinct
and relatively individualized parts. Each homogeneous group
of sacred things, or even each sacred thing of some importance,
constitutes a centre of organization about which gravitate a
group of beliefs and rites, or a particular cult; there is no religion,
howsoever unified it may be, which does not recognize a plurality
of sacred things. Even Christianity, at least in its Catholic form,
admits, in addition to the divine personality which, incidentally,
is triple as well as one, the Virgin, angels, saints, souls of the dead,
etc. Thus a religion cannot be reduced to one single cult generally,
but father consists in a system of cults, each endowed with a
certain autonomy. Also, this autonomy is variable. Sometimes
they are arranged in a hierarchy, and subordinated to some predominating
cult, into which they are finally absorbed; but sometimes,
also, they are merely rearranged and united. The religion
which we are going to study will furnish us with an example of
just this latter sort of organization.</p>

<p>At the same time we find the explanation of how there can be
groups of religious phenomena which do not belong to any special
religion; it is because they have not been, or are no longer, a
part of any religious system. If, for some special reason, one of
the cults of which we just spoke happens to be maintained while
the group of which it was a part disappears, it survives only in a
disintegrated condition. That is what has happened to many
agrarian cults which have survived themselves as folk-lore. In
certain cases, it is not even a cult, but a simple ceremony or
particular rite which persists in this way.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>	</p>

<p>Although this definition is only preliminary, it permits us to
see in what terms the problem which necessarily dominates the
science of religions should be stated. When we believed that
sacred beings could be distinguished from others merely by the
greater intensity of the powers attributed to them, the question
of how men came to imagine them was sufficiently simple: it was
enough to demand which forces had, because of their exceptional
energy, been able to strike the human imagination forcefully
enough to inspire religious sentiments. But if, as we have sought
to establish, sacred things differ in nature from profane things,
if they have a wholly different essence, then the problem is
more complex. For we must first of all ask what has been able
to lead men to see in the world two heterogeneous and incompatible
worlds, though nothing sensible experience seems able
to suggest the idea of so radical a duality to them.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>However, this definition is not yet complete, for it is equally
applicable to two sorts of facts which, while being related to each
other, must be distinguished nevertheless: these are magic and
religion.</p>

<p>Magic, too, is made up of beliefs and rites. Like religion, it
has its myths and its dogmas; only they are more elementary,
undoubtedly because, seeking technical and utilitarian ends, it
does not waste its time in pure speculation. It has its ceremonies,
sacrifices, lustrations, prayers, chants and dances as well. The
beings which the magician invokes and the forces which he
throws in play are not merely of the same nature as the forces
and beings to which religion addresses itself; very frequently,
they are identically the same. Thus, even with the most inferior
societies, the souls of the dead are essentially sacred things, and
the object of religious rites. But at the same time, they play a
considerable r&ocirc;le in magic. In Australia<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> as well as in Melanesia,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
in Greece as well as among the Christian peoples,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> the souls of
the dead, their bones and their hair, are among the intermediaries
used the most frequently by the magician. Demons are also a
common instrument for magic action. Now these demons are
also beings surrounded with interdictions; they too are separated
and live in a world apart, so that it is frequently difficult to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
distinguish them from the gods properly so-called.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Moreover, in
Christianity itself, is not the devil a fallen god, or even leaving
aside all question of his origin, does he not have a religious character
from the mere fact that the hell of which he has charge is
something indispensable to the Christian religion? There are
even some regular and official deities who are invoked by the
magician. Sometimes these are the gods of a foreign people;
for example, Greek magicians called upon Egyptian, Assyrian or
Jewish gods. Sometimes, they are even national gods: Hecate
and Diana were the object of a magic cult; the Virgin, Christ
and the saints have been utilized in the same way by Christian
magicians.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Then will it be necessary to say that magic is hardly distinguishable
from religion; that magic is full of religion just as
religion is full of magic, and consequently that it is impossible
to separate them and to define the one without the other? It is
difficult to sustain this thesis, because of the marked repugnance
of religion for magic, and in return, the hostility of the second
towards the first. Magic takes a sort of professional pleasure in
profaning holy things;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in its rites, it performs the contrary of
the religious ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> On its side, religion, when it has not
condemned and prohibited magic rites, has always looked upon
them with disfavour. As Hubert and Mauss have remarked, there
is something thoroughly anti-religious in the doings of the
magician.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Whatever relations there may be between these two
sorts of institutions, it is difficult to imagine their not being
opposed somewhere; and it is still more necessary for us to find
where they are differentiated, as we plan to limit our researches
to religion, and to stop at the point where magic commences.</p>

<p>Here is how a line of demarcation can be traced between these
two domains.</p>

<p>The really religious beliefs are always common to a determined
group, which makes profession of adhering to them and of practising
the rites connected with them. They are not merely
received individually by all the members of this group; they
are something belonging to the group, and they make its unity.
The individuals which compose it feel themselves united to each
other by the simple fact that they have a common faith. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
society whose members are united by the fact that they think in
the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with
the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these
common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church.
In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church.
Sometimes the Church is strictly national, sometimes it passes
the frontiers; sometimes it embraces an entire people (Rome,
Athens, the Hebrews), sometimes it embraces only a part of them
(the Christian societies since the advent of Protestantism);
sometimes it is directed by a corps of priests, sometimes it is
almost completely devoid of any official directing body.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> But
wherever we observe the religious life, we find that it has a definite
group as its foundation. Even the so-called private cults, such
as the domestic cult or the cult of a corporation, satisfy this
condition; for they are always celebrated by a group, the family
or the corporation. Moreover, even these particular religions
are ordinarily only special forms of a more general religion
which embraces all;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> these restricted Churches are in reality
only chapels of a vaster Church which, by reason of this very
extent, merits this name still more.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>It is quite another matter with magic. To be sure, the belief
in magic is always more or less general; it is very frequently
diffused in large masses of the population, and there are even
peoples where it has as many adherents as the real religion. But
it does not result in binding together those who adhere to it, nor
in uniting them into a group leading a common life. <i>There is no
Church of magic.</i> Between the magician and the individuals
who consult him, as between these individuals themselves, there
are no lasting bonds which make them members of the same moral
community, comparable to that formed by the believers in the
same god or the observers of the same cult. The magician has a
clientele and not a Church, and it is very possible that his clients
have no other relations between each other, or even do not know
each other; even the relations which they have with him are
generally accidental and transient; they are just like those of a
sick man with his physician. The official and public character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with which he is sometimes invested changes nothing in this
situation; the fact that he works openly does not unite him
more regularly or more durably to those who have recourse to
his services.</p>

<p>It is true that in certain cases, magicians form societies among
themselves: it happens that they assemble more or less
periodically to celebrate certain rites in common; it is well
known what a place these assemblies of witches hold in European
folk-lore. But it is to be remarked that these associations are in
no way indispensable to the working of the magic; they are even
rare and rather exceptional. The magician has no need of uniting
himself to his fellows to practise his art. More frequently, he is
a recluse; in general, far from seeking society, he flees it. "Even
in regard to his colleagues, he always keeps his personal independence."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Religion, on the other hand, is inseparable from
the idea of a Church. From this point of view, there is an essential
difference between magic and religion. But what is especially
important is that when these societies of magic are formed,
they do not include all the adherents to magic, but only the
magicians; the laymen, if they may be so called, that is to say,
those for whose profit the rites are celebrated, in fine, those who
represent the worshippers in the regular cults, are excluded.
Now the magician is for magic what the priest is for religion, but
a college of priests is not a Church, any more than a religious
congregation which should devote itself to some particular saint
in the shadow of a cloister, would be a particular cult. A Church
is not a fraternity of priests; it is a moral community formed by
all the believers in a single faith, laymen as well as priests. But
magic lacks any such community.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>But if the idea of a Church is made to enter into the definition
of religion, does that not exclude the private religions which the
individual establishes for himself and celebrates by himself?
There is scarcely a society where these are not found. Every
Ojibway, as we shall see below, has his own personal <i>manitou</i>,
which he chooses himself and to which he renders special religious
services; the Melanesian of the Banks Islands has his <i>tamaniu</i>;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
the Roman, his <i>genius</i>;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the Christian, his patron saint and
guardian angel, etc. By definition all these cults seem to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
independent of all idea of the group. Not only are these individual
religions very frequent in history, but nowadays many
are asking if they are not destined to be the pre-eminent form of
the religious life, and if the day will not come when there will be
no other cult than that which each man will freely perform within
himself.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>But if we leave these speculations in regard to the future aside
for the moment, and confine ourselves to religions such as they
are at present or have been in the past, it becomes clearly evident
that these individual cults are not distinct and autonomous
religious systems, but merely aspects of the common religion of
the whole Church, of which the individuals are members. The
patron saint of the Christian is chosen from the official list of
saints recognized by the Catholic Church; there are even canonical
rules prescribing how each Catholic should perform this private
cult. In the same way, the idea that each man necessarily has a
protecting genius is found, under different forms, at the basis of
a great number of American religions, as well as of the Roman
religion (to cite only these two examples); for, as will be seen
later, it is very closely connected with the idea of the soul, and
this idea of the soul is not one of those which can be left entirely
to individual choice. In a word, it is the Church of which he is
a member which teaches the individual what these personal gods
are, what their function is, how he should enter into relations
with them and how he should honour them. When a methodical
analysis is made of the doctrines of any Church whatsoever,
sooner or later we come upon those concerning private cults.
So these are not two religions of different types, and turned in
opposite directions; both are made up of the same ideas and the
same principles, here applied to circumstances which are of
interest to the group as a whole, there to the life of the individual.
This solidarity is even so close that among certain peoples,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the
ceremonies by which the faithful first enter into communication
with their protecting geniuses are mixed with rites whose public
character is incontestable, namely the rites of initiation.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>There still remain those contemporary aspirations towards a
religion which would consist entirely in internal and subjective
states, and which would be constructed freely by each of us.
But howsoever real these aspirations may be, they cannot affect
our definition, for this is to be applied only to facts already
realized, and not to uncertain possibilities. One can define
religions such as they are, or such as they have been, but not
such as they more or less vaguely tend to become. It is possible
that this religious individualism is destined to be realized in facts;
but before we can say just how far this may be the case, we must
first know what religion is, of what elements it is made up, from
what causes it results, and what function it fulfils&mdash;all questions
whose solution cannot be foreseen before the threshold of our
study has been passed. It is only at the close of this study that
we can attempt to anticipate the future.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at the following definition: <i>A religion is a
unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that
is to say, things set apart and forbidden&mdash;beliefs and practices which
unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who
adhere to them.</i> The second element which thus finds a place in
our definition is no less essential than the first; for by showing
that the idea of religion is inseparable from that of the Church, it
makes it clear that religion should be an eminently collective
thing.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER II</b><br /><br />

<small>LEADING CONCEPTIONS OF THE ELEMENTARY RELIGION</small><br /><br />

I.&mdash;<i>Animism</i></h3>


<p>Armed with this definition, we are now able to set out in
search of this elementary religion which we propose to
study.</p>

<p>Even the crudest religions with which history and ethnology
make us acquainted are already of a complexity which corresponds
badly with the idea sometimes held of primitive mentality.
One finds there not only a confused system of beliefs and rites,
but also such a plurality of different principles, and such a
richness of essential notions, that it seems impossible to see in
them anything but the late product of a rather long evolution.
Hence it has been concluded that to discover the truly original
form of the religious life, it is necessary to descend by analysis
beyond these observable religions, to resolve them into their
common and fundamental elements, and then to seek among
these latter some one from which the others were derived.</p>

<p>To the problem thus stated, two contrary solutions have
been given.</p>

<p>There is no religious system, ancient or recent, where one
does not meet, under different forms, two religions, as it were,
side by side, which, though being united closely and mutually
penetrating each other, do not cease, nevertheless, to be distinct.
The one addresses itself to the phenomena of nature,
either the great cosmic forces, such as winds, rivers, stars or the
sky, etc., or else the objects of various sorts which cover the
surface of the earth, such as plants, animals, rocks, etc.; for
this reason it has been given the name of <i>naturism</i>. The other
has spiritual beings as its object, spirits, souls, geniuses, demons,
divinities properly so-called, animated and conscious agents
like man, but distinguished from him, nevertheless, by the
nature of their powers and especially by the peculiar characteristic
that they do not affect the senses in the same way: ordinarily
they are not visible to human eyes. This religion of spirits is
called <i>animism</i>. Now, to explain the universal co-existence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
these two sorts of cults, two contradictory theories have been
proposed. For some, animism is the primitive religion, of which
naturism is only a secondary and derived form. For the others,
on the contrary, it is the nature cult which was the point of
departure for religious evolution; the cult of spirits is only a
peculiar case of that.</p>

<p>These two theories are, up to the present, the only ones by
which the attempt has been made to explain rationally<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the
origins of religious thought. Thus the capital problem raised
by the history of religions is generally reduced to asking which
of these two solutions should be chosen, or whether it is not
better to combine them, and in that case, what place must be
given to each of the two elements.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Even those scholars who do
not admit either of these hypotheses in their systematic form,
do not refuse to retain certain propositions upon which they rest.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Thus we have a certain number of theories already made, which
must be submitted to criticism before we take up the study of
the facts for ourselves. It will be better understood how indispensable
it is to attempt a new one, when we have seen the
insufficiency of these traditional conceptions.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It is Tylor who formed the animist theory in its essential
outlines.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Spencer, who took it up after him, did not reproduce
it without introducing certain modifications.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But in general
the questions are posed by each in the same terms, and the
solutions accepted are, with a single exception, identically the
same. Therefore we can unite these two doctrines in the exposition
which follows, if we mark, at the proper moment, the place
where the two diverge from one another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to find the elementary form of the religious life in
these animistic beliefs and practices, three <i>desiderata</i> must be
satisfied: first, since according to this hypothesis, the idea of
the soul is the cardinal idea of religion, it must be shown how
this is formed without taking any of its elements from an anterior
religion; secondly, it must be made clear how souls become the
object of a cult and are transformed into spirits; and thirdly
and finally, since the cult of these spirits is not all of any religion,
it remains to be explained how the cult of nature is derived
from it.</p>


<p class="npara">According to this theory, the idea of the soul was first suggested
to men by the badly understood spectacle of the double life they
ordinarily lead, on the one hand, when awake, on the other,
when asleep. In fact, for the savage,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the mental representations
which he has while awake and those of his dreams are
said to be of the same value: he objectifies the second like the
first, that is to say, that he sees in them the images of external
objects whose appearance they more or less accurately reproduce.
So when he dreams that he has visited a distant country, he
believes that he really was there. But he could not have gone
there, unless two beings exist within him: the one, his body,
which has remained lying on the ground and which he finds in
the same position on awakening; the other, during this time,
has travelled through space. Similarly, if he seems to talk with
one of his companions who he knows was really at a distance,
he concludes that the other also is composed of two beings:
one which sleeps at a distance, and another which has come to
manifest himself by means of the dream. From these repeated
experiences, he little by little arrives at the idea that each of us
has a double, another self, which in determined conditions has
the power of leaving the organism where it resides and of going
roaming at a distance.</p>

<p>Of course, this double reproduces all the essential traits of the
perceptible being which serves it as external covering; but at
the same time it is distinguished from this by many characteristics.
It is more active, since it can cover vast distances in
an instant. It is more malleable and plastic; for, to leave the
body, it must pass out by its apertures, especially the mouth and
nose. It is represented as made of matter, undoubtedly, but of
a matter much more subtile and etherial than any which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
know empirically. This double is the soul. In fact, it cannot be
doubted that in numerous societies the soul has been conceived
in the image of the body; it is believed that it reproduces even
the accidental deformities such as those resulting from wounds
or mutilations. Certain Australians, after having killed their
enemy, cut off his right thumb, so that his soul, deprived of its
thumb also, cannot throw a javelin and revenge itself. But
while it resembles the body, it has, at the same time, something
half spiritual about it. They say that "it is the finer or more
aeriform part of the body," that "it has no flesh nor bone nor
sinew"; that when one wishes to take hold of it, he feels nothing;
that it is "like a purified body."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Also, other facts of experience which affect the mind in the
same way naturally group themselves around this fundamental
fact taught by the dream: fainting, apoplexy, catalepsy,
ecstasy, in a word, all cases of temporary insensibility. In fact,
they all are explained very well by the hypothesis that the
principle of life and feeling is able to leave the body momentarily.
Also, it is natural that this principle should be confounded with
the double, since the absence of the double during sleep daily
has the effect of suspending thought and life. Thus diverse
observations seem to agree mutually and to confirm the idea
of the constitutional duality of man.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>


<p class="npara">But the soul is not a spirit. It is attached to a body which it
can leave only by exception; in so far as it is nothing more
than that, it is not the object of any cult. The spirit, on the
other hand, though generally having some special thing as its
residence, can go away at will, and a man can enter into relations
with it only by observing ritual precautions. The soul can
become a spirit, then, only by transforming itself: the simple
application of these preceding ideas to the fact of death produced
this metamorphosis quite naturally. For a rudimentary
intelligence, in fact, death is not distinguished from a long
fainting swoon or a prolonged sleep; it has all their aspects.
Thus it seems that it too consists in a separation of the soul and
the body, analogous to that produced every night; but as in
such cases, the body is not reanimated, the idea is formed of a
separation without an assignable limit of time. When the body
is once destroyed&mdash;and funeral rites have the object of hastening
this destruction&mdash;the separation is taken as final. Hence come
spirits detached from any organism and left free in space. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
their number augments with time, a population of souls forms
around the living population. These souls of men have the
needs and passions of men; they seek to concern themselves
with the life of their companions of yesterday, either to aid
them or to injure them, according to the sentiments which they
have kept towards them. According to the circumstances, their
nature makes them either very precious auxiliaries or very
redoubtable adversaries. Owing to their extreme fluidity, they
can even enter into the body, and cause all sorts of disorders
there, or else increase its vitality. Thus comes the habit of
attributing to them all those events of life which vary slightly
from the ordinary: there are very few of these for which they
cannot account. Thus they constitute a sort of ever-ready
supply of causes which never leaves one at a loss when in search
of explanations. Does a man appear inspired, does he speak
with energy, is it as though he were lifted outside himself and
above the ordinary level of men? It is because a good spirit is
in him and animates him. Is he overtaken by an attack or
seized by madness? It is because an evil spirit has entered into
him and brought him all this trouble. There are no maladies
which cannot be assigned to some influence of this sort. Thus
the power of souls is increased by all that men attribute to
them, and in the end men find themselves the prisoners of this
imaginary world of which they are, however, the authors and
the models. They fall into dependence upon these spiritual
forces which they have created with their own hands and in
their own image. For if souls are the givers of health and sickness,
of goods and evils to this extent, it is wise to conciliate
their favour or appease them when they are irritated; hence
come the offerings, prayers, sacrifices, in a word, all the apparatus
of religious observances.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Here is the soul transformed. From a simple vital principle
animating the body of a man, it has become a spirit, a good or
evil genius, or even a deity, according to the importance of
the effects with which it is charged. But since it is death which
brought about this apotheosis, it is to the dead, to the souls of
ancestors, that the first cult known to humanity was addressed.
Thus the first rites were funeral rites; the first sacrifices were
food offerings destined to satisfy the needs of the departed;
the first altars were tombs.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>


<p class="npara">But since these spirits were of human origin, they interested
themselves only in the life of men and were thought to act only
upon human events. It is still to be explained how other spirits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
were imagined to account for the other phenomena of the universe
and how the cult of nature was subsequently formed beside that
of the ancestors.</p>

<p>For Tylor, this extension of animism was due to the particular
mentality of the primitive who, like an infant, cannot distinguish
the animate and the inanimate. Since the first beings of which
the child commences to have an idea are men, that is, himself
and those around him, it is upon this model of human nature
that he tends to think of everything. The toys with which he
plays, or the objects of every sort which affect his senses, he
regards as living beings like himself. Now the primitive thinks
like a child. Consequently, he also is inclined to endow all
things, even inanimate ones, with a nature analogous to his
own. Then if, for the reasons exposed above, he once arrives
at the idea that man is a body animated by a spirit, he must
necessarily attribute a duality of this sort and souls like his own
even to inert bodies themselves. Yet the sphere of action of
the two could not be the same. The souls of men have a direct
influence only upon the world of men: they have a marked
preference for the human organism, even when death has given
them their liberty. On the other hand, the souls of things reside
especially in these things, and are regarded as the productive
causes of all that passes there. The first account for health and
sickness, skilfulness or unskilfulness, etc.; by the second are
explained especially the phenomena of the physical world, the
movement of water-courses or the stars, the germination of
plants, the reproduction of animals, etc. Thus the first philosophy
of man, which is at the basis of the ancestor-cult, is completed
by a philosophy of the world.</p>

<p>In regard to these cosmic spirits, man finds himself in a state
of dependence still more evident than that in regard to the
wandering doubles of his ancestors. For he could have only
ideal and imaginary relations with the latter, but he depends
upon things in reality; to live, he has need of their concurrence;
he then believes that he has an equal need of the spirits which
appear to animate these things and to determine their diverse
manifestations. He implores their assistance, he solicits them
with offerings and prayers, and the religion of man is thus
completed in a religion of nature.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer objects against this explanation that the
hypothesis upon which it rests is contradicted by the facts.
It is held, he says, that there is a time when men do not realize
the differences which separate the animate from the inanimate.
Now, as one advances in the animal scale, he sees the ability
to make this distinction develop. The superior animals do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
confound an object which moves of itself and whose movements
are adapted to certain ends, with those which are mechanically
moved from without. "Amusing herself with a mouse she has
caught, the cat, if it remains long stationary, touches it with her
paw to make it run. Obviously the thought is that a living thing
disturbed will try to escape."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Even the primitive men could not
have an intelligence inferior to that of the animals which preceded
them in evolution; then it cannot be for lack of discernment that
they passed from the cult of ancestors to the cult of things.</p>

<p>According to Spencer, who upon this point, but upon this
point only, differs from Tylor, this passage was certainly due
to a confusion, but to one of a different sort. It was, in a large
part at least, the result of numerous errors due to language.
In many inferior societies it is a very common custom to give to
each individual, either at his birth or later, the name of some
animal, plant, star or natural object. But as a consequence of
the extreme imprecision of his language, it is very difficult for
a primitive to distinguish a metaphor from the reality. He soon
lost sight of the fact that these names were only figures, and
taking them literally, he ended by believing that an ancestor
named "Tiger" or "Lion" was really a tiger or a lion. Then
the cult of which the ancestor was the object up to that time,
was changed over to the animal with which he was thereafter
confounded; and as the same substitution went on for the
plants, the stars and all the natural phenomena, the religion
of nature took the place of the old religion of the dead. Besides
this fundamental confusion, Spencer signalizes others which
aided the action of the first from time to time. For example,
the animals which frequent the surroundings of the tombs or
houses of men have been taken for their reincarnated souls, and
adored under this title;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> or again, the mountain which tradition
made the cradle of the race was finally taken for the ancestor
of the race; it was thought that men were descended from it
because their ancestors appeared coming from it, and it was
consequently treated as an ancestor itself.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But according to
the statement of Spencer, these accessory causes had only a
secondary influence; that which principally determined the
institution of naturism was "the literal interpretation of
metaphorical names."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>We had to mention this theory to have our exposition of
animism complete; but it is too inadequate for the facts, and
too universally abandoned to-day to demand that we stop any
longer for it. In order to explain a fact as general as the religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of nature by an illusion, it would be necessary that the illusion
invoked should have causes of an equal generality. Now even
if misunderstandings, such as those of which Spencer gives some
rare illustrations, could explain the transformation of the cult
of ancestors into that of nature, it is not clear why this should
be produced with a sort of universality. No psychical mechanism
necessitated it. It is true that because of its ambiguity, the word
might lead to an equivocation; but on the other hand, all the
personal souvenirs left by the ancestor in the memories of men
should oppose this confusion. Why should the tradition which
represented the ancestor such as he really was, that is to say,
as a man who led the life of a man, everywhere give way before
the prestige of a word? Likewise, one should have a little
difficulty in admitting that men were born of a mountain or a
star, of an animal or a plant; the idea of a similar exception to
the ordinary conceptions of generation could not fail to raise
active resistance. Thus, it is far from true that the error found
a road all prepared before it, but rather, all sorts of reasons should
have kept it from being accepted. It is difficult to understand
how, in spite of all these obstacles, it could have triumphed so
generally.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The theory of Tylor, whose authority is always great, still
remains. His hypotheses on the dream and the origin of the
ideas of the soul and of spirits are still classic; it is necessary,
therefore, to test their value.</p>

<p>First of all, it should be recognized that the theorists of
animism have rendered an important service to the science of
religions, and even to the general history of ideas, by submitting
the idea of the soul to historical analysis. Instead of following
so many philosophers and making it a simple and immediate
object of consciousness, they have much more correctly viewed
it as a complex whole, a product of history and mythology. It
cannot be doubted that it is something essentially religious in
its nature, origin and functions. It is from religion that the
philosophers received it; it is impossible to understand the form
in which it is represented by the thinkers of antiquity, if one
does not take into account the mythical elements which served
in its formation.</p>

<p>But if Tylor has had the merit of raising this problem, the
solution he gives raises grave difficulties.</p>

<p>First of all, there are reservations to be made in regard to the
very principle which is at the basis of this theory. It is taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for granted that the soul is entirely distinct from the body, that
it is its double, and that within it or outside of it, it normally lives
its own autonomous life. Now we shall see<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that this conception
is not that of the primitive, or at least, that it only expresses
one aspect of his idea of the soul. For him, the soul, though
being under certain conditions independent of the organism
which it animates, confounds itself with this latter to such an
extent that it cannot be radically separated from it: there are
organs which are not only its appointed seat, but also its outward
form and material manifestation. The notion is therefore more
complex than the doctrine supposes, and it is doubtful consequently
whether the experiences mentioned are sufficient to
account for it; for even if they did enable us to understand how
men have come to believe themselves double, they cannot
explain how this duality does not exclude, but rather, implies
a deeper unity and an intimate interpenetration of the two beings
thus differentiated.</p>

<p>But let us admit that the idea of the soul can be reduced to
the idea of a double, and then see how this latter came to be
formed. It could not have been suggested to men except by the
experience of dreams. That they might understand how they
could see places more or less distant during sleep, while their
bodies remained lying on the ground, it would seem that they
were led to conceive of themselves as two beings: on the one
hand, the body, and on the other, a second self, able to leave
the organism in which it lives and to roam about in space. But
if this hypothesis of a double is to be able to impose itself upon
men with a sort of necessity, it should be the only one possible,
or at least, the most economical one. Now as a matter of fact,
there are more simple ones which, it would seem, might have
occurred to the mind just as naturally. For example, why
should the sleeper not imagine that while asleep he is able to
see things at a distance? To imagine such a power would
demand less expense to the imagination than the construction
of this complex notion of a double, made of some etherial, semi-invisible
substance, and of which direct experience offers no
example. But even supposing that certain dreams rather
naturally suggest the animistic explanation, there are certainly
many others which are absolutely incompatible with it. Often
our dreams are concerned with passed events; we see again the
things which we saw or did yesterday or the day before or even
during our youth, etc.; dreams of this sort are frequent and
hold a rather considerable place in our nocturnal life. But the
idea of a double cannot account for them. Even if the double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
can go from one point to another in space, it is not clear how it
could possibly go back and forth in time. Howsoever rudimentary
his intelligence may be, how could a man on awakening
believe that he had really been assisting at or taking part in
events which he knows passed long before? How could he
imagine that during his sleep he lived a life which he knows has
long since gone by? It would be much more natural that he
should regard these renewed images as merely what they really
are, that is, as souvenirs like those which he has during the day,
but ones of a special intensity.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the scenes of which we are the actors and witnesses
while we sleep, it constantly happens that one of our contemporaries
has a r&ocirc;le as well as ourselves: we think we see and hear
him in the same place where we see ourselves. According to the
animists, the primitive would explain this by imagining that his
double was visited by or met with those of certain of his companions.
But it would be enough that on awakening he question
them, to find that their experiences do not coincide with his.
During this same time, they too have had dreams, but wholly
different ones. They have not seen themselves participating in the
same scene; they believe that they have visited wholly different
places. Since such contradictions should be the rule in these
cases, why should they not lead men to believe that there
had probably been an error, that they had merely imagined it,
that they had been duped by illusions? This blind credulity
which is attributed to the primitive is really too simple. It is
not true that he must objectify all his sensations. He cannot
live long without perceiving that even when awake his senses
sometimes deceive him. Then why should he believe them more
infallible at night than during the day? Thus we find that
there are many reasons opposing the theory that he takes his
dreams for the reality and interprets them by means of a double
of himself.</p>

<p>But more than that, even if every dream were well explained
by the hypothesis of a double, and could not be explained
otherwise, it would remain a question why men have attempted
to explain them. Dreams undoubtedly constitute the matter
of a possible problem. But we pass by problems every day
which we do not raise, and of which we have no suspicion until
some circumstance makes us feel the necessity of raising them.
Even when the taste for pure speculation is aroused, reflection
is far from raising all the problems to which it could eventually
apply itself; only those attract it which present a particular
interest. Especially, when it is a question of facts which always
take place in the same manner, habit easily numbs curiosity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
we do not even dream of questioning them. To shake off this
torpor, it is necessary that practical exigencies, or at least a very
pressing theoretical interest, stimulate our attention and turn
it in this direction. That is why, at every moment of history,
there have been so many things that we have not tried to understand,
without even being conscious of our renunciation. Up
until very recent times, it was believed that the sun was only
a few feet in diameter. There is something incomprehensible
in the statement that a luminous disc of such slight dimensions
could illuminate the world: yet for centuries men never thought
of resolving this contradiction. The fact of heredity has been
known for a long time, but it is very recently that the attempt
has been made to formulate its theory. Certain beliefs were even
admitted which rendered it wholly unintelligible: thus in many
Australian societies of which we shall have occasion to speak,
the child is not physiologically the offspring of its parents.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This intellectual laziness is necessarily at its maximum among
the primitive peoples. These weak beings, who have so much
trouble in maintaining life against all the forces which assail it,
have no means for supporting any luxury in the way of speculation.
They do not reflect except when they are driven to it.
Now it is difficult to see what could have led them to make
dreams the theme of their meditations. What does the dream
amount to in our lives? How little is the place it holds, especially
because of the very vague impressions it leaves in the memory,
and of the rapidity with which it is effaced from remembrance,
and consequently, how surprising it is that a man of so rudimentary
an intelligence should have expended such efforts to
find its explanation! Of the two existences which he successively
leads, that of the day and that of the night, it is the first which
should interest him the most. Is it not strange that the second
should have so captivated his attention that he made it the
basis of a whole system of complicated ideas destined to have
so profound an influence upon his thought and conduct?</p>

<p>Thus all tends to show that, in spite of the credit it still enjoys,
the animistic theory of the soul must be revised. It is true that
to-day the primitive attributes his dreams, or at least certain
of them, to displacements of his double. But that does not say
that the dream actually furnished the materials out of which
the idea of the double or the soul was first constructed; it might
have been applied afterwards to the phenomena of dreams,
ecstasy and possession, without having been derived from them.
It is very frequent that, after it has been formed, an idea is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
employed to co-ordinate or illuminate&mdash;with a light frequently
more apparent than real&mdash;certain facts with which it had no
relation at first, and which would never have suggested it themselves.
God and the immortality of the soul are frequently
proven to-day by showing that these beliefs are implied in the
fundamental principles of morality; as a matter of fact, they
have quite another origin. The history of religious thought
could furnish numerous examples of these retrospective justifications,
which can teach us nothing of the way in which the
ideas were formed, nor of the elements out of which they are
composed.</p>

<p>It is also probable that the primitive distinguishes between
his dreams, and does not interpret them all in the same way.
In our European societies the still numerous persons for whom
sleep is a sort of magico-religious state in which the mind, being
partially relieved of the body, has a sharpness of vision which
it does not enjoy during waking moments, do not go to the point
of considering all their dreams as so many mystic intuitions:
on the contrary, along with everybody else, they see in the
majority of their dreams only profane conditions, vain plays
of images, or simple hallucinations. It might be supposed that
the primitive should make analogous distinctions. Codrington
says distinctly that the Melanesians do not attribute all their
dreams indiscriminately to the wanderings of their souls, but
merely those which strike their imagination forcibly:<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> undoubtedly
by that should be understood those in which the
sleeper imagines himself in relations with religious beings, good
or evil geniuses, souls of the dead, etc. Similarly, the Dieri in
Australia sharply distinguish ordinary dreams from those
nocturnal visions in which some deceased friend or relative
shows himself to them. In the first, they see a simple fantasy
of their imagination; they attribute the second to the action
of an evil spirit.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> All the facts which Howitt mentions as
examples to show how the Australian attributes to the soul the
power of leaving the body, have an equally mystic character.
The sleeper believes himself transported into the land of the
dead or else he converses with a dead companion.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> These
dreams are frequent among the primitives.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It is probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
upon these facts that the theory is based. To account for them,
it is admitted that the souls of the dead come back to the living
during their sleep. This theory was the more readily accepted
because no fact of experience could invalidate it. But these
dreams were possible only where the ideas of spirits, souls and
a land of the dead were already existent, that is to say, where
religious evolution was relatively advanced. Thus, far from
having been able to furnish to religion the fundamental notion
upon which it rests, they suppose a previous religious system,
upon which they depended.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>We now arrive at that which constitutes the very heart of
the doctrine.</p>

<p>Wherever this idea of a double may come from, it is not
sufficient, according to the avowal of the animists themselves,
to explain the formation of the cult of the ancestors which they
would make the initial type of all religions. If this double is to
become the object of a cult, it must cease to be a simple reproduction
of the individual, and must acquire the characteristics
necessary to put it in the rank of sacred beings. It is death,
they say, which performs this transformation. But whence
comes the virtue which they attribute to this? Even were the
analogy of sleep and death sufficient to make one believe that
the soul survives the body (and there are reservations to be made
on this point), why does this soul, by the mere fact that it is now
detached from the organism, so completely change its nature?
If it was only a profane thing, a wandering vital principle,
during life, how does it become a sacred thing all at once, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the object of religious sentiments? Death adds nothing essential
to it, except a greater liberty of movement. Being no longer
attached to a special residence, from now on, it can do at any
time what it formerly did only by night; but the action of which
it is capable is always of the same sort. Then why have the
living considered this uprooted and vagabond double of their
former companion as anything more than an equal? It was
a fellow-creature, whose approach might be inconvenient;
it was not a divinity.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>It seems as though death ought to have the effect of weakening
vital energies, instead of strengthening them. It is, in fact, a
very common belief in the inferior societies that the soul
participates actively in the life of the body. If the body is
wounded, it is wounded itself and in a corresponding place.
Then it should grow old along with the body. In fact, there are
peoples who do not render funeral honours to men arrived at
senility; they are treated as if their souls also had become
senile.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> It even happens that they regularly put to death, before
they arrive at old age, certain privileged persons, such as kings
or priests, who are supposed to be the possessors of powerful
spirits whose protection the community wishes to keep. They
thus seek to keep the spirit from being affected by the physical
decadence of its momentary keepers; with this end in view,
they take it from the organism where it resides before age can
have weakened it, and they transport it, while it has as yet
lost nothing of its vigour, into a younger body where it will be
able to keep its vitality intact.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> So when death results from
sickness or old age, it seems as though the soul could retain only
a diminished power; and if it is only its double, it is difficult to
see how it could survive at all, after the body is once definitely
dissolved. From this point of view, the idea of survival is
intelligible only with great difficulty. There is a logical and
psychological gap between the idea of a double at liberty and
that of a spirit to which a cult is addressed.</p>

<p>This interval appears still more considerable when we realize
what an abyss separates the sacred world from the profane;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
it becomes evident that a simple change of degree could not be
enough to make something pass from one category into the
other. Sacred beings are not distinguished from profane ones
merely by the strange or disconcerting forms which they take
or by the greater powers which they enjoy; between the two
there is no common measure. Now there is nothing in the
notion of a double which could account for so radical a heterogeneity.
It is said that when once freed from the body, the spirit
can work all sorts of good or evil for the living, according to the
way in which it regards them. But it is not enough that a being
should disturb his neighbourhood to seem to be of a wholly
different nature from those whose tranquillity it menaces. To
be sure, in the sentiment which the believer feels for the things
he adores, there always enters in some element of reserve and
fear; but this is a fear <i>sui generis</i>, derived from respect more
than from fright, and where the dominating emotion is that
which <i>la majest&eacute;</i> inspires in men. The idea of majesty is essentially
religious. Then we have explained nothing of religion
until we have found whence this idea comes, to what it corresponds
and what can have aroused it in the mind. Simple souls
of men cannot become invested with this character by the
simple fact of being no longer incarnate.</p>

<p>This is clearly shown by an example from Melanesia. The
Melanesians believe that men have souls which leave the body
at death; it then changes its name and becomes what they call
a <i>tindalo</i>, a <i>natmat</i>, etc. Also, they have a cult of the souls of
the dead: they pray to them, invoke them and make offerings
and sacrifices to them. But every <i>tindalo</i> is not the object of
these ritual practices; only those have this honour which come
from men to whom public opinion attributed, during life, the
very special virtue which the Melanesians call the <i>mana</i>. Later
on, we shall have occasion to fix precisely the meaning which
this word expresses; for the time being, it will suffice to say
that it is the distinctive character of every sacred being. As
Codrington says, "it is what works to effect anything which
is beyond the ordinary power of men, outside the common
processes of nature."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> A priest, a sorcerer or a ritual formula
have mana as well as a sacred stone or spirit. Thus the
only tindalo to which religious services are rendered are those
which were already sacred of themselves, when their proprietor
was still alive. In regard to the other souls, which come
from ordinary men, from the crowd of the profane, the same
author says that they are "nobodies alike before and after
death."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> By itself, death has no deifying virtue. Since it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
brings about in a more or less complete and final fashion the
separation of the soul from profane things, it can well reinforce
the sacred character of the soul, if this already exists, but it
cannot create it.</p>

<p>Moreover, if, as the hypothesis of the animists supposes, the
first sacred beings were really the souls of the dead and the
first cult that of the ancestors, it should be found that the lower
the societies examined are, the more the place given to this cult
in the religious life. But it is rather the contrary which is true.
The ancestral cult is not greatly developed, or even presented
under a characteristic form, except in advanced societies like
those of China, Egypt or the Greek and Latin cities; on the
other hand, it is completely lacking in the Australian societies
which, as we shall see, represent the lowest and simplest form
of social organization which we know. It is true that funeral
rites and rites of mourning are found there; but these practices
do not constitute a cult, though this name has sometimes wrongfully
been given them. In reality, a cult is not a simple group
of ritual precautions which a man is held to take in certain
circumstances; it is a system of diverse rites, festivals and
ceremonies which <i>all have this characteristic, that they reappear
periodically</i>. They fulfil the need which the believer feels of
strengthening and reaffirming, at regular intervals of time, the
bond which unites him to the sacred beings upon which he
depends. That is why one speaks of marriage rites but not of a
marriage cult, of rites of birth but not of a cult of the new-born
child; it is because the events on the occasion of which these
rites take place imply no periodicity. In the same way, there
is no cult of the ancestors except when sacrifices are made on
the tombs from time to time, when libations are poured there
on certain more or less specific dates, or when festivals are
regularly celebrated in honour of the dead. But the Australian
has no relations of this sort with his dead. It is true that he
must bury their remains according to a ritual, mourn for them
during a prescribed length of time and in a prescribed manner,
and revenge them if there is occasion to.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> But when he has once
accomplished these pious tasks, when the bones are once dry
and the period of mourning is once accomplished, then all is
said and done, and the survivors have no more duties towards
their relatives who exist no longer. It is true that there is a
way in which the dead continue to hold a place in the lives of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
their kindred, even after the mourning is finished. It is sometimes
the case that their hair or certain of their bones are kept,
because of special virtues which are attached to them.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> But
by that time they have ceased to exist as persons, and have
fallen to the rank of anonymous and impersonal charms. In
this condition they are the object of no cult; they serve only
for magical purposes.</p>

<p>However, there are certain Australian tribes which periodically
celebrate rites in honour of fabulous ancestors whom tradition
places at the beginning of time. These ceremonies generally
consist in a sort of dramatic representation in which are
rehearsed the deeds which the myths ascribe to these legendary
heroes.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But the personages thus represented are not men who,
after living the life of men, have been transformed into a sort
of god by the fact of their death. They are considered to have
exercised superhuman powers while alive. To them is attributed
all that is grand in the history of the tribe, or even of the whole
world. It is they who in a large measure made the earth such
as it is, and men such as they are. The haloes with which they
are still decorated do not come to them merely from the fact
that they are ancestors, that is to say, in fine, that they are dead,
but rather from the fact that a divine character is and always
has been attributed to them; to use the Melanesian expression,
it is because they are constitutionally endowed with mana.
Consequently, there is nothing in these rites which shows that
death has the slightest power of deification. It cannot even be
correctly said of certain rites that they form an ancestor-cult,
since they are not addressed to ancestors as such. In order to
have a real cult of the dead, it is necessary that after death
real ancestors, the relations whom men really lose every day,
become the object of the cult; let us repeat it once more, there
are no traces of any such cult in Australia.</p>

<p>Thus the cult which, according to this hypothesis, ought to
be the predominating one in inferior societies, is really nonexistent
there. In reality, the Australian is not concerned with
his dead, except at the moment of their decease and during the
time which immediately follows. Yet these same peoples, as
we shall see, have a very complex cult for sacred beings of a
wholly different nature, which is made up of numerous ceremonies
and frequently occupying weeks or even entire months.
It cannot be admitted that the few rites which the Australian
performs when he happens to lose one of his relatives were the
origin of these permanent cults which return regularly every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
year and which take up a considerable part of his existence.
The contrast between the two is so great that we may even ask
whether the first were not rather derived from the second, and
if the souls of men, far from having been the model upon which
the gods were originally imagined, have not rather been conceived
from the very first as emanations from the divinity.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>From the moment that the cult of the dead is shown not to
be primitive, animism lacks a basis. It would then seem useless
to discuss the third thesis of the system, which concerns the
transformation of the cult of the dead into the cult of nature.
But since the postulate upon which it rests is also found in
certain historians of religion who do not admit the animism
properly so-called, such as Brinton,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Lang,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> R&eacute;ville,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and even
Robertson Smith himself,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> it is necessary to make an examination
of it.</p>

<p>This extension of the cult of the dead to all nature is said to
come from the fact that we instinctively tend to represent all
things in our own image, that is to say, as living and thinking
beings. We have seen that Spencer has already contested the
reality of this so-called instinct. Since animals clearly distinguish
living bodies from dead ones, it seemed to him impossible
that man, the heir of the animals, should not have had this same
faculty of discernment from the very first. But howsoever
certain the facts cited by Spencer may be, they have not the
demonstrative value which he attributes to them. His reasoning
supposes that all the faculties, instincts and aptitudes of the
animal have passed integrally into man; now many errors
have their origin in this principle which is wrongfully taken as
a proven truth. For example, since sexual jealousy is generally
very strong among the higher animals, it has been concluded
that it ought to be found among men with the same intensity
from the very beginnings of history.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> But it is well known
to-day that men can practise a sexual communism which would
be impossible if this jealousy were not capable of attenuating
itself and even of disappearing when necessary.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The fact is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that man is not merely an animal with certain additional qualities:
he is something else. Human nature is the result of a sort
of recasting of the animal nature, and in the course of the various
complex operations which have brought about this recasting,
there have been losses as well as gains. How many instincts
have we not lost? The reason for this is that men are not only
in relations with the physical environment, but also with a
social environment infinitely more extended, more stable and
more active than the one whose influence animals undergo.
To live, they must adapt themselves to this. Now in order to
maintain itself, society frequently finds it necessary that we
should see things from a certain angle and feel them in a certain
way; consequently it modifies the ideas which we would
ordinarily make of them for ourselves and the sentiments to
which we would be inclined if we listened only to our animal
nature; it alters them, even going so far as to put the contrary
sentiments in their place. Does it not even go so far as to make
us regard our own individual lives as something of little value,
while for the animal this is the greatest of things?<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Then it is
a vain enterprise to seek to infer the mental constitution of the
primitive man from that of the higher animals.</p>

<p>But if the objection of Spencer does not have the decisive
value which its author gives it, it is equally true that the animist
theory can draw no authority from the confusions which children
seem to make. When we hear a child angrily apostrophize an
object which he has hit against, we conclude that he thinks of
it as a conscious being like himself; but that is interpreting
his words and acts very badly. In reality, he is quite a stranger
to the very complicated reasoning attributed to him. If he
lays the blame on the table which has hurt him, it is not because
he supposes it animated and intelligent, but because it has hurt
him. His anger, once aroused by the pain, must overflow;
so it looks for something upon which to discharge itself, and
naturally turns toward the thing which has provoked it, even
though this has no effect. The action of an adult in similar
circumstances is often as slightly reasonable. When we are
violently irritated, we feel the need of inveighing, of destroying,
though we attribute no conscious ill-will to the objects upon
which we vent our anger. There is even so little confusion that
when the emotion of a child is calmed, he can very well distinguish
a chair from a person: he does not act in at all the
same way towards the two. It is a similar reason which explains
his tendency to treat his playthings as if they were living beings.
It is his extremely intense need of playing which thus finds a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
means of expressing itself, just as in the other case the violent
sentiments caused by pain created an object out of nothing.
In order that he may consciously play with his jumping-jack,
he imagines it a living person. This illusion is the easier for him
because imagination is his sovereign mistress; he thinks almost
entirely with images, and we know how pliant images are,
bending themselves with docility before every exigency of the
will. But he is so little deceived by his own fiction that he would
be the first to be surprised if it suddenly became a reality, and
his toy bit him!<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Let us therefore leave these doubtful analogies to one side.
To find out if men were primitively inclined to the confusions
imputed to them, we should not study animals or children of
to-day, but the primitive beliefs themselves. If the spirits and
gods of nature were really formed in the image of the human
soul, they should bear traces of their origin and bring to mind
the essential traits of their model. The most important characteristic
of the soul is that it is conceived as the internal
principle which animates the organism: it is that which moves
it and makes it live, to such an extent that when it withdraws
itself, life ceases or is suspended. It has its natural residence
in the body, at least while this exists. But it is not thus with
the spirits assigned to the different things in nature. The god
of the sun is not necessarily in the sun, nor is the spirit of a
certain rock in the rock which is its principal place of habitation.
A spirit undoubtedly has close relations with the body to which
it is attached, but one employs a very inexact expression when
he says that it is its soul. As Codrington says,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> "there does not
appear to be anywhere in Melanesia a belief in a spirit which
animates any natural object, a tree, waterfall, storm or rock,
so as to be to it what the soul is believed to be to the body of
man. Europeans, it is true, speak of the spirits of the sea or of
the storm or of the forest; but the native idea which they
represent is that ghosts haunt the sea and the forest, having
power to raise storms and strike a traveller with disease." While
the soul is essentially within the body, the spirit passes the
major portion of its time outside the object which serves as its
base. This is one difference which does not seem to show that
the second idea was derived from the first.</p>

<p>From another point of view, it must be added that if men
were really forced to project their own image into things, then
the first sacred beings ought to have been conceived in their likeness.
Now anthropomorphism, far from being primitive, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
rather the mark of a relatively advanced civilization. In the
beginning, sacred beings are conceived in the form of an animal
or vegetable, from which the human form is only slowly disengaged.
It will be seen below that in Australia, it is animals
and plants which are the first sacred beings. Even among the
Indians of North America, the great cosmic divinities, which
commence to be the object of a cult there, are very frequently
represented in animal forms.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> "The difference between the
animal, man and the divine being," says R&eacute;ville, not without
surprise, "is not felt in this state of mind, and generally it might
be said that <i>it is the animal form which is the fundamental one</i>."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
To find a god made up entirely of human elements, it is necessary
to advance nearly to Christianity. Here, God is a man, not only
in the physical aspect in which he is temporarily made manifest,
but also in the ideas and sentiments which he expresses. But
even in Greece and Rome, though the gods were generally
represented with human traits, many mythical personages
still had traces of an animal origin: thus there is Dionysus,
who is often met with in the form of a bull, or at least with the
horns of a bull; there is Demeter, who is often represented with
a horse's mane, there are Pan and Silenus, there are the Fauns,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It is not at all true that man has had such an inclination
to impose his own form upon things. More than that, he even
commenced by conceiving of himself as participating closely in
the animal nature. In fact, it is a belief almost universal in
Australia, and very widespread among the Indians of North
America, that the ancestors of men were beasts or plants, or at
least that the first men had, either in whole or in part, the
distinctive characters of certain animal or vegetable species.
Thus, far from seeing beings like themselves everywhere, men
commenced by believing themselves to be in the image of some
beings from which they differed radically.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Finally, the animistic theory implies a consequence which is
perhaps its best refutation.</p>

<p>If it were true, it would be necessary to admit that religious
beliefs are so many hallucinatory representations, without any
objective foundation whatsoever. It is supposed that they are
all derived from the idea of the soul because one sees only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
magnified soul in the spirits and gods. But according to Tylor
and his disciples, the idea of the soul is itself constructed entirely
out of the vague and inconsistent images which occupy our
attention during sleep: for the soul is the double, and the double
is merely a man as he appears to himself while he sleeps. From
this point of view, then, sacred beings are only the imaginary
conceptions which men have produced during a sort of delirium
which regularly overtakes them every day, though it is quite
impossible to see to what useful ends these conceptions serve,
nor what they answer to in reality. If a man prays, if he makes
sacrifices and offerings, if he submits to the multiple privations
which the ritual prescribes, it is because a sort of constitutional
eccentricity has made him take his dreams for perceptions,
death for a prolonged sleep, and dead bodies for living and
thinking beings. Thus not only is it true, as many have held,
that the forms under which religious powers have been represented
to the mind do not express them exactly, and that
the symbols with the aid of which they have been thought of
partially hide their real nature, but more than that, behind
these images and figures there exists nothing but the nightmares
of primitive minds. In fine, religion is nothing but a dream,
systematized and lived, but without any foundation in reality.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Thence it comes about that the theorists of animism, when looking
for the origins of religious thought, content themselves with a
small outlay of energy. When they think that they have explained
how men have been induced to imagine beings of a
strange, vaporous form, such as those they see in their dreams,
they think the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>In reality, it is not even approached. It is inadmissible that
systems of ideas like religions, which have held so considerable
a place in history, and to which, in all times, men have come
to receive the energy which they must have to live, should be
made up of a tissue of illusions. To-day we are beginning to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
realize that law, morals and even scientific thought itself were
born of religion, were for a long time confounded with it, and
have remained penetrated with its spirit. How could a vain
fantasy have been able to fashion the human consciousness so
strongly and so durably? Surely it ought to be a principle of
the science of religions that religion expresses nothing which
does not exist in nature; for there are sciences only of natural
phenomena. The only question is to learn from what part of
nature these realities come and what has been able to make
men represent them under this singular form which is peculiar
to religious thought. But if this question is to be raised, it is
necessary to commence by admitting that they are real things
which are thus represented. When the philosophers of the
eighteenth century made religion a vast error imagined by the
priests, they could at least explain its persistence by the interest
which the sacerdotal class had in deceiving the people. But if
the people themselves have been the artisans of these systems
of erroneous ideas at the same time that they were its dupes,
how has this extraordinary dupery been able to perpetuate
itself all through the course of history?</p>

<p>One might even demand if under these conditions the words
of science of religions can be employed without impropriety.
A science is a discipline which, in whatever manner it is
conceived, is always applied to some real data. Physics and
chemistry are sciences because physico-chemical phenomena
are real, and of a reality which does not depend upon the truths
which these sciences show. There is a psychological science
because there are really consciousnesses which do not hold their
right of existence from the psychologist. But on the contrary,
religion could not survive the animistic theory and the day
when its truth was recognized by men, for they could not fail
to renounce the errors whose nature and origin would thus be
revealed to them. What sort of a science is it whose principal
discovery is that the subject of which it treats does not exist?</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER III</b><br /><br />

<small>LEADING CONCEPTIONS OF THE ELEMENTARY RELIGION&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

II.&mdash;<i>Naturism</i></h3>


<p>The spirit of the naturistic school is quite different.
In the first place, it is recruited in a different environment.
The animists are, for the most part, ethnologists or anthropologists.
The religions which they have studied are the crudest
which humanity has ever known. Hence comes the extraordinary
importance which they attribute to the souls of the
dead, to spirits and to demons, and, in fact, to all spiritual
beings of the second order: it is because these religions know
hardly any of a higher order.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> On the contrary, the theories
which we are now going to describe are the work of scholars who
have concerned themselves especially with the great civilizations
of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Ever since the work of the Grimm brothers, who pointed out
the interest that there is in comparing the different mythologies
of the Indo-European peoples, scholars have been struck by the
remarkable similarities which these present. Mythical personages
were identified who, though having different names, symbolized
the same ideas and fulfilled the same functions; even the names
were frequently related, and it has been thought possible to
establish the fact that they are not unconnected with one another.
Such resemblances seemed to be explicable only by a common
origin. Thus they were led to suppose that these conceptions,
so varied in appearance, really came from one common source,
of which they were only diversified forms, and which it was not
impossible to discover. By the comparative method, they
believed one should be able to go back, beyond these great
religions, to a much more ancient system of ideas, and to the
really primitive religion, from which the others were derived.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Vedas aided greatly in stimulating these
ambitions. In the Vedas, scholars had a written text, whose
antiquity was undoubtedly exaggerated at the moment of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
discovery, but which is surely one of the most ancient which we
have at our disposition in an Indo-European language. Here
they were enabled to study, by the ordinary methods of philology,
a literature as old as or older than Homer, and a religion which
was believed more primitive than that of the ancient Germans.
A document of such value was evidently destined to throw a new
light upon the religious beginnings of humanity, and the science
of religions could not fail to be revolutionized by it.</p>

<p>The conception which was thus born was so fully demanded by
the state of the science and by the general march of ideas, that it
appeared almost simultaneously in two different lands. In 1856,
Max M&uuml;ller exposed its principles in his <i>Oxford Essays</i>.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Three
years later appeared the work of Adalbert Kuhn on <i>The Origin
of Fire and the Drink of the Gods</i>,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> which was clearly inspired by
the same spirit. When once set forth, the idea spread very
rapidly in scientific circles. To the name of Kuhn is closely
associated that of his brother-in-law Schwartz, whose work on
<i>The Origin of Mythology</i>,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> followed closely upon the preceding
one. Steinthal and the whole German school of <i>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</i>
attached themselves to the same movement. The theory was
introduced into France in 1863 by M. Michel Br&eacute;al.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It met so
little resistance that, according to an expression of Gruppe,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> "a
time came when, aside from certain classical philologists, to
whom Vedic studies were unknown, all the mythologists had
adopted the principles of Max M&uuml;ller or Kuhn as their point of
departure."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It is therefore important to see what they really
are, and what they are worth.</p>

<p>Since no one has presented them in a more systematic form
than Max M&uuml;ller, it is upon his work that we shall base the
description which follows.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>We have seen that the postulate at the basis of animism is that
religion, at least in its origin, expresses no physical reality. But
Max M&uuml;ller commences with the contrary principle. For him,
it is an axiom that religion reposes upon an experience, from
which it draws all its authority. "Religion," he says, "if it is
to hold its place as a legitimate element of our consciousness,
must, like all other knowledge, begin with sensuous experience."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Taking up the old empirical adage, "<i>Nihil est in intellectu quod
non ante fuerit in sensu</i>," he applies it to religion and declares
that there can be nothing in beliefs which was not first perceived.
So here is a doctrine which seems to escape the grave objection
which we raised against animism. From this point of view, it
seems that religion ought to appear, not as a sort of vague and
confused dreaming, but as a system of ideas and practices well
founded in reality.</p>

<p>But which are these sensations which give birth to religious
thought? That is the question which the study of the Vedas is
supposed to aid in resolving.</p>

<p>The names of the gods are generally either common words, still
employed, or else words formerly common, whose original sense
it is possible to discover. Now both designate the principal
phenomena of nature. Thus <i>Agni</i>, the name of one of the principal
divinities of India, originally signified only the material fact of
fire, such as it is ordinarily perceived by the senses and without
any mythological addition. Even in the Vedas, it is still employed
with this meaning; in any case, it is well shown that this signification
was primitive by the fact that it is conserved in other Indo-European
languages: the Latin <i>ignis</i>, the Lithuanian <i>ugnis</i>, the
old Slav <i>ogny</i> are evidently closely related to Agni. Similarly,
the relationship of the Sanskrit <i>Dyaus</i>, the Greek <i>Zeus</i>, the Latin
<i>Jovis</i> and the <i>Zio</i> of High German is to-day uncontested. This
proves that these different words designate one single and the
same divinity, whom the different Indo-European peoples recognized
as such before their separation. Now Dyaus signifies the
bright sky. These and other similar facts tend to show that
among these peoples the forms and forces of nature were the
first objects to which the religious sentiment attached itself:
they were the first things to be deified. Going one step farther
in his generalization, Max M&uuml;ller thought that he was prepared
to conclude that the religious evolution of humanity in general
had the same point of departure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It is almost entirely by considerations of a psychological sort
that he justifies these inferences. The varied spectacles which
nature offers man seemed to him to fulfil all the conditions
necessary for arousing religious ideas in the mind directly.
In fact, he says, "at first sight, nothing seemed less natural than
nature. Nature was the greatest surprise, a terror, a marvel, a
standing miracle, and it was only on account of their permanence,
constancy, and regular recurrence that certain features of that
standing miracle were called natural, in the sense of foreseen,
common, intelligible.... It was that vast domain of surprise, of
terror, of marvel, of miracle, the unknown, as distinguished from
the known, or, as I like to express it, the infinite, as distinct from
the finite, which supplied from the earliest times the impulse to
religious thought and language."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In order to illustrate his idea,
he applies it to a natural force which holds a rather large place
in the Vedic religion, fire. He says, "if you can for a moment
transfer yourselves to that early stage of life to which we must
refer not only the origin, but likewise the early phases of Physical
Religion, you can easily understand what an impression the first
appearance of fire must have made on the human mind. Fire
was not given as something permanent or eternal, like the sky,
or the earth, or the water. In whatever way it first appeared,
whether through lightning or through the friction of the branches
of trees, or through the sparks of flints, it came and went, it had
to be guarded, it brought destruction, but at the same time, it
made life possible in winter, it served as a protection during the
night, it became a weapon of defence and offence, and last, not
least, it changed man from a devourer of raw flesh into an eater
of cooked meat. At a later time it became the means of working
metal, of making tools and weapons, it became an indispensable
factor in all mechanical and artistic progress, and has remained
so ever since. What should we be without fire even now?"<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
The same author says in another work that a man could not enter
into relations with nature without taking account of its immensity,
of its infiniteness. It surpasses him in every way. Beyond the
distances which he perceives, there are others which extend
without limits; each moment of time is preceded and followed
by a time to which no limit can be assigned; the flowing river
manifests an infinite force, since nothing can exhaust it.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> There
is no aspect of nature which is not fitted to awaken within us
this overwhelming sensation of an infinity which surrounds us and
dominates us.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It is from this sensation that religions are derived.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>However, they are there only in germ.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Religion really
commences only at the moment when these natural forces are no
longer represented in the mind in an abstract form. They must
be transformed into personal agents, living and thinking beings,
spiritual powers or gods; for it is to beings of this sort that the
cult is generally addressed. We have seen that animism itself
has been obliged to raise this question, and also how it has
answered it: man seems to have a sort of native incapacity for
distinguishing the animate from the inanimate and an irresistible
tendency to conceive the second under the form of the first.
Max M&uuml;ller rejects any such solution.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> According to him it is
language which has brought about this metamorphosis, by the
action which it exercises upon thought.</p>


<p class="npara">It is easily explained how men, being perplexed by the marvellous
forces upon which they feel that they depend, have been
led to reflect upon them, and how they have asked themselves
what these forces are and have made an effort to substitute for
the obscure sensation which they primitively had of them, a
clearer idea and a better defined concept. But as our author very
justly says,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> this idea and concept are impossible without the
word. Language is not merely the external covering of a thought;
it also is its internal framework. It does not confine itself to
expressing this thought after it has once been formed; it also
aids in making it. However, its nature is of a different sort, so
its laws are not those of thought. Then since it contributes to
the elaboration of this latter, it cannot fail to do it violence to
some extent, and to deform it. It is a deformation of this sort
which is said to have created the special characteristic of religious
thought.</p>

<p>Thinking consists in arranging our ideas, and consequently in
classifying them. To think of fire, for example, is to put it into
a certain category of things, in such a way as to be able to say
that it is this or that, or this and not that. But classifying is also
naming, for a general idea has no existence and reality except in
and by the word which expresses it and which alone makes its
individuality. Thus the language of a people always has an
influence upon the manner in which new things, recently learned,
are classified in the mind and are subsequently thought of; these
new things are thus forced to adapt themselves to pre-existing
forms. For this reason, the language which men spoke when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
undertook to construct an elaborated representation of the
universe marked the system of ideas which was then born with
an indelible trace.</p>

<p>Nor are we without some knowledge of this language, at least
in so far as the Indo-European peoples are concerned. Howsoever
distant it may be from us, souvenirs of it remain in our actual
languages which permit us to imagine what it was: these are the
roots. These stems, from which are derived all the words which we
employ and which are found at the basis of all the Indo-European
languages, are regarded by Max M&uuml;ller as so many echoes of the
language which the corresponding peoples spoke before their
separation, that is to say, at the very moment when this religion
of nature, which is to be explained, was being formed. Now these
roots present two remarkable characteristics, which, it is true,
have as yet been observed only in this particular group of
languages, but which our author believes to be present equally
in the other linguistic families.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>In the first place, the roots are general; that is to say that
they do not express particular things and individuals, but types,
and even types of an extreme generality. They represent the
most general themes of thought; one finds there, as though
fixed and crystallized, those fundamental categories of the intellect
which at every moment in history dominate the entire
mental life, the arrangement of which philosophers have many
times attempted to reconstruct.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, the types to which they correspond are types of
action, and not of objects. They translate the most general
manners of acting which are to be observed among living beings
and especially among men; they are such actions as striking,
pushing, rubbing, lying down, getting up, pressing, mounting,
descending, walking, etc. In other words, men generalized and
named their principal ways of acting before generalizing and
naming the phenomena of nature.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Owing to their extreme generality, these words could easily
be extended to all sorts of objects which they did not originally
include; it is even this extreme suppleness which has permitted
them to give birth to the numerous words which are derived
from them. Then when men, turning towards things, undertook
to name them, that they might be able to think about them,
they applied these words to them, though they were in no way
designed for them. But, owing to their origin, these were able to
designate the forces of nature only by means of their manifestations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
which seemed the nearest to human actions: a thunderbolt
was called <i>something</i> that tears up the soil or that spreads
fire; the wind, <i>something</i> that sighs or whistles; the sun, <i>something</i>
that throws golden arrows across space; a river, <i>something</i>
that flows, etc. But since natural phenomena were thus compared
to human acts, this <i>something</i> to which they were attached was
necessarily conceived under the form of personal agents, more or
less like men. It was only a metaphor, but it was taken literally;
the error was inevitable, for science, which alone could dispel the
illusion, did not yet exist. In a word, since language was made
of human elements, translating human states, it could not be
applied to nature without transforming it.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Even to-day, remarks
M. Br&eacute;al, it forces us in a certain measure to represent
things from this angle. "We do not express an idea, even one
designating a simple quality, without giving it a gender, that is
to say, a sex; we cannot speak of an object, even though it be
considered in a most general fashion, without determining it by
an article; every subject of a sentence is presented as an active
being, every idea as an action, and every action, be it transitory
or permanent, is limited in its duration by the tense in which
we put the verb."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Our scientific training enables us to rectify
the errors which language might thus suggest to us; but the
influence of the word ought to be all-powerful when it has no
check. Language thus superimposes upon the material world,
such as it is revealed to our senses, a new world, composed wholly
of spiritual beings which it has created out of nothing and which
have been considered as the causes determining physical phenomena
ever since.</p>

<p>But its action does not stop there. When words were once
forged to represent these personalities which the popular imagination
had placed behind things, a reaction affected these words
themselves: they raised all sorts of questions, and it was to
resolve these problems that myths were invented. It happened
that one object received a plurality of names, corresponding to
the plurality of aspects under which it was presented in experience;
thus there are more than twenty words in the Vedas
for the sky. Since these words were different, it was believed
that they corresponded to so many distinct personalities. But
at the same time, it was strongly felt that these same personalities
had an air of relationship. To account for that, it was imagined
that they formed a single family; genealogies, a civil condition
and a history were invented for them. In other cases, different
things were designated by the same term: to explain these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
homonyms, it was believed that the corresponding things were
transformations of each other, and new fictions were invented
to make these metamorphoses intelligible. Or again, a word
which had ceased to be understood, was the origin of fables
designed to give it a meaning. The creative work of language
continued then, making constructions ever more and more
complex, and then mythology came to endow each god with a
biography, ever more and more extended and complete, the
result of all of which was that the divine personalities, at first
confounded with things, finally distinguished and determined
themselves.</p>

<p>This is how the notion of the divine is said to have been constructed.
As for the religion of ancestors, it was only a reflection
of this other.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The idea of the soul is said to have been first
formed for reasons somewhat analogous to those given by Tylor,
except that according to Max M&uuml;ller, they were designed to
account for death, rather than for dreams.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Then, under the
influence of diverse, partially accidental, circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> the
souls of men, being once disengaged from the body, were drawn
little by little within the circle of divine beings, and were thus
finally deified themselves. But this new cult was the product of
only a secondary formation. This is proven by the fact that
deified men have generally been imperfect gods or demi-gods,
whom the people have always been able to distinguish from the
genuine deities.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>This doctrine rests, in part, upon a certain number of linguistic
postulates which have been and still are very much questioned.
Some have contested the reality of many of the similarities
which Max M&uuml;ller claimed to have found between the names of
the gods in the various European languages. The interpretation
which he gave them has been especially doubted: it has been
asked if these names, far from being the mark of a very primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
religion, are not the slow product, either of direct borrowings or
of natural intercourse with others.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Also, it is no longer admitted
that the roots once existed in an isolated state as autonomous
realities, nor that they allow us to reconstruct, even hypothetically,
the original language of the Indo-Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Finally,
recent researches would tend to show that the Vedic divinities
did not all have the exclusively naturistic character attributed
to them by Max M&uuml;ller and his school.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But we shall leave aside
those questions, the discussion of which requires a special competence
as a philologist, and address ourselves directly to the
general principles of the system. It will be important here not
to confound the naturistic theory with these controverted postulates;
for this is held by numbers of scholars who do not make
language play the predominating r&ocirc;le attributed to it by Max
M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>That men have an interest in knowing the world which surrounds
them, and consequently that their reflection should have
been applied to it at an early date, is something that everyone
will readily admit. Co-operation with the things with which
they were in immediate connection was so necessary for them
that they could not fail to seek a knowledge of their nature. But
if, as naturism pretends, it is of these reflections that religious
thought was born, it is impossible to explain how it was able to
survive the first attempts made, and the persistence with which
it has maintained itself becomes unintelligible. If we have need of
knowing the nature of things, it is in order to act upon them in
an appropriate manner. But the conception of the universe
given us by religion, especially in its early forms, is too greatly
mutilated to lead to temporarily useful practices. Things become
nothing less than living and thinking beings, minds or personalities
like those which the religious imagination has made into
the agents of cosmic phenomena. It is not by conceiving of
them under this form or by treating them according to this
conception that men could make them work for their ends. It is
not by addressing prayers to them, by celebrating them in feasts
and sacrifices, or by imposing upon themselves fasts and privations,
that men can deter them from working harm or oblige
them to serve their own designs. Such processes could succeed
only very exceptionally and, so to speak, miraculously. If, then,
religion's reason for existence was to give us a conception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
world which would guide us in our relations with it, it was in
no condition to fulfil its function, and people would not have
been slow to perceive it: failures, being infinitely more frequent
than successes, would have quickly shown them that they were
following a false route, and religion, shaken at each instant by
these repeated contradictions, would not have been able to
survive.</p>

<p>It is undeniably true that errors have been able to perpetuate
themselves in history; but, except under a union of very exceptional
circumstances, they can never perpetuate themselves
thus unless they were <i>true practically</i>, that is to say, unless,
without giving us a theoretically exact idea of the things with
which they deal, they express well enough the manner in which
they affect us, either for good or for bad. Under these circumstances,
the actions which they determine have every chance of
being, at least in a general way, the very ones which are proper,
so it is easily explained how they have been able to survive the
proofs of experience.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But an error and especially a system of
errors which leads to, and can lead to nothing but mistaken and
useless practices, has no chance of living. Now what is there in
common between the rites with which the believer tries to act
upon nature and the processes by which science has taught
us to make use of it, and which we now know are the only
efficacious ones? If that is what men demanded of religion, it
is impossible to see how it could have maintained itself, unless
clever tricks had prevented their seeing that it did not give
them what they expected from it. It would be necessary to
return again to the over simple explanations of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is only in appearance that naturism escapes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
objection which we recently raised against animism. It also
makes religion a system of hallucinations, since it reduces it to
an immense metaphor with no objective value. It is true that it
gives religion a point of departure in reality, to wit, in the sensations
which the phenomena of nature provoke in us; but by the
bewitching action of language, this sensation is soon transformed
into extravagant conceptions. Religious thought does not come
in contact with reality, except to cover it at once with a thick
veil which conceals its real forms: this veil is the tissue of fabulous
beliefs which mythology brought forth. Thus the believer, like
the delirious man, lives in a world peopled with beings and things
which have only a verbal existence. Max M&uuml;ller himself recognized
this, for he regarded myths as the product of a disease of
the intellect. At first, he attributed them to a disease of language,
but since language and the intellect are inseparable for him, what
is true of the one is true of the other. "When trying to explain
the inmost nature of mythology," he says, "I called it a disease
of Language rather than of Thought.... After I had fully explained
in my <i>Science of Thought</i> that language and thought are
inseparable, and that a disease of language is therefore the same
thing as a disease of thought, no doubt ought to have remained
as to what I meant. To represent the supreme God as committing
every kind of crime, as being deceived by men, as being angry
with his wife and violent with his children, is surely a proof of a
disease, of an unusual condition of thought, or, to speak more
clearly, of real madness."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> And this argument is not valid
merely against Max M&uuml;ller and his theory, but against the very
principle of naturism, in whatever way it may be applied. Whatever
we may do, if religion has as its principal object the expression
of the forces of nature, it is impossible to see in it anything
more than a system of lying fictions, whose survival is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Max M&uuml;ller thought he escaped this objection, whose gravity
he felt, by distinguishing radically between mythology and
religion, and by putting the first outside the second. He claims
the right of reserving the name of religion for only those beliefs
which conform to the prescriptions of a sane moral system
and a rational theology. The myths were parasitic growths
which, under the influence of language, attached themselves
upon these fundamental conceptions, and denatured them.
Thus the belief in Zeus was religious in so far as the Greeks
considered him the supreme God, father of humanity, protector
of laws, avenger of crimes, etc.; but all that which concerned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the biography of Zeus, his marriages and his adventures, was
only mythology.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>But this distinction is arbitrary. It is true that mythology
has an &aelig;sthetic interest as well as one for the history of religions;
but it is one of the essential elements of the religious life, nevertheless.
If the myth were withdrawn from religion, it would be
necessary to withdraw the rite also; for the rites are generally
addressed to definite personalities who have a name, a character,
determined attributes and a history, and they vary according to
the manner in which these personalities are conceived. The cult rendered
to a divinity depends upon the character attributed to him;
and it is the myth which determines this character. Very frequently,
the rite is nothing more than the myth put in action; the Christian
communion is inseparable from the myth of the Last Supper, from
which it derives all its meaning. Then if all mythology is the
result of a sort of verbal delirium, the question which we raised
remains intact: the existence, and especially the persistence of
the cult become inexplicable. It is hard to understand how men
have continued to do certain things for centuries without any
object. Moreover, it is not merely the peculiar traits of the divine
personalities which are determined by mythology; the very idea
that there are gods or spiritual beings set above the various
departments of nature, in no matter what manner they may be
represented, is essentially mythical.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Now if all that which appertains
to the notion of gods conceived as cosmic agents is blotted
out of the religions of the past, what remains? The idea of a
divinity in itself, of a transcendental power upon which man
depends and upon which he supports himself? But that is
only an abstract and philosophic conception which has been fully
realized in no historical religion; it is without interest for the
science of religions.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> We must therefore avoid distinguishing
between religious beliefs, keeping some because they seem to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to be true and sane and rejecting others because they shock and
disconcert us. All myths, even those which we find the most
unreasonable, have been believed.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>  Men have believed in
them no less firmly than in their own sensations; they have
based their conduct upon them. In spite of appearances, it
is therefore impossible that they should be without objective
foundation.</p>

<p>However, it will be said that in whatever manner religions may
be explained, it is certain that they are mistaken in regard to
the real nature of things: science has proved it. The modes of
action which they counsel or prescribe to men can therefore
rarely have useful effects: it is not by lustrations that the
sick are cured nor by sacrifices and chants that the crops are
made to grow. Thus the objection which we have made to
naturism would seem to be applicable to all possible systems of
explanation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is one which escapes it. Let us suppose
that religion responds to quite another need than that of adapting
ourselves to sensible objects: then it will not risk being weakened
by the fact that it does not satisfy, or only badly satisfies, this
need. If religious faith was not born to put man in harmony
with the material world, the injuries which it has been able to
do him in his struggle with the world do not touch it at its
source, because it is fed from another.</p>

<p>If it is not for these reasons that a man comes to believe,
he should continue to believe even when these reasons are
contradicted by the facts. It is even conceivable that faith
should be strong enough, not only to support these contradictions,
but also even to deny them and to keep the believer from seeing
their importance; this is what succeeds in rendering them
inoffensive for religion. When the religious sentiment is active,
it will not admit that religion can be in the wrong, and it readily
suggests explanations which make it appear innocent; if the
rite does not produce the desired results, this failure is imputed
either to some fault of execution, or to the intervention of another,
contrary deity. But for that, it is necessary that these religious
ideas have their source in another sentiment than that
betrayed by these deceptions of experience, or else whence could
come their force of resistance?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>But more than that, even if men had really had reasons for
remaining obstinate, in spite of all their mistakes, in expressing
cosmic phenomena in religious terms, it is also necessary that
these be of a nature to suggest such an interpretation. Now
when could they have gotten such a property? Here again we
find ourselves in the presence of one of those postulates which
pass as evident only because they have not been criticized. It
is stated as an axiom that in the natural play of physical forces
there is all that is needed to arouse within us the idea of the
sacred; but when we closely examine the proofs of this proposition,
which, by the way, are sufficiently brief, we find that they
reduce to a prejudice.</p>

<p>They talk about the marvel which men should feel as they
discover the world. But really, that which characterizes the life
of nature is a regularity which approaches monotony. Every
morning the sun mounts in the horizon, every evening it sets;
every month the moon goes through the same cycle; the river
flows in an uninterrupted manner in its bed; the same seasons
periodically bring back the same sensations. To be sure, here
and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is
eclipsed, the moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows.
But these momentary variations could only give birth to equally
momentary impressions, the remembrance of which is gone
after a little while; they could not serve as a basis for these
stable and permanent systems of ideas and practices which
constitute religions. Normally, the course of nature is uniform,
and uniformity could never produce strong emotions. Representing
the savage as filled with admiration before these marvels
transports much more recent sentiments to the beginnings of
history. He is much too accustomed to it to be greatly surprised
by it. It requires culture and reflection to shake off this yoke
of habit and to discover how marvellous this regularity itself is.
Besides, as we have already remarked,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> admiring an object is
not enough to make it appear sacred to us, that is to say, to mark
it with those characteristics which make all direct contact with
it appear a sacrilege and a profanation. We misunderstand what
the religious sentiment really is, if we confound it with every
impression of admiration and surprise.</p>

<p>But, they say, even if it is not admiration, there is a certain
impression which men cannot help feeling in the presence of
nature. He cannot come in contact with it, without realizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that it is greater than he. It overwhelms him by its immensity.
This sensation of an infinite space which surrounds him, of an
infinite time which has preceded and will follow the present
moment, and of forces infinitely superior to those of which he is
master, cannot fail, as it seems, to awaken within him the idea
that outside of him there exists an infinite power upon which he
depends. And this idea enters as an essential element into our
conception of the divine.</p>

<p>But let us bear in mind what the question is. We are trying to
find out how men came to think that there are in reality two
categories of things, radically heterogeneous and incomparable
to each other. Now how could the spectacle of nature give rise
to the idea of this duality? Nature is always and everywhere
of the same sort. It matters little that it extends to infinity:
beyond the extreme limit to which my eyes can reach, it is not
different from what it is here. The space which I imagine beyond
the horizon is still space, identical with that which I see. The
time which flows without end is made up of moments identical
with those which I have passed through. Extension, like duration,
repeats itself indefinitely; if the portions which I touch
have of themselves no sacred character, where did the others
get theirs? The fact that I do not see them directly, is not
enough to transform them.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> A world of profane things may
well be unlimited; but it remains a profane world. Do they
say that the physical forces with which we come in contact
exceed our own? Sacred forces are not to be distinguished from
profane ones simply by their greater intensity, they are different;
they have special qualities which the others do not have. Quite
on the contrary, all the forces manifested in the universe are of
the same nature, those that are within us just as those that are
outside of us. And especially, there is no reason which could
have allowed giving a sort of pre-eminent dignity to some in
relation to others. Then if religion really was born because of
the need of assigning causes to physical phenomena, the forces
thus imagined would have been no more sacred than those conceived
by the scientist to-day to account for the same facts.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
This is as much as to say that there would have been no sacred
beings and therefore no religion.</p>

<p>But even supposing that this sensation of being "overwhelmed"
were really able to suggest religious ideas, it could not have
produced this effect upon the primitive, for he does not have it.
He is in no way conscious that cosmic forces are so superior to
his own. Since science has not yet taught him modesty, he
attributes to himself an empire over things which he really does
not have, but the illusion of which is enough to prevent his feeling
dominated by them. As we have already pointed out, he thinks
that he can command the elements, release the winds, compel
the rain to fall, or stop the sun, by a gesture, etc.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Religion itself
contributes to giving him this security, for he believes that it
arms him with extended powers over nature. His rites are, in
part, means destined to aid him in imposing his will upon the
world. Thus, far from being due to the sentiment which men
should have of their littleness before the universe, religions
are rather inspired by the contrary sentiment. Even the most
elevated and idealistic have the effect of reassuring men in their
struggle with things: they teach that faith is, of itself, able
"to move mountains," that is to say, to dominate the forces of
nature. How could they give rise to this confidence if they had
had their origin in a sensation of feebleness and impotency?</p>

<p>Finally, if the objects of nature really became sacred because
of their imposing forms or the forces which they manifest, then
the sun, the moon, the sky, the mountains, the sea, the winds, in
a word, the great cosmic powers, should have been the first to be
raised to this dignity; for there are no others more fitted to
appeal to the senses and the imagination. But as a matter of
fact, they were divinized but slowly. The first beings to which
the cult is addressed&mdash;the proof will be found in the chapters
which follow&mdash;are humble vegetables and animals, in relation to
which men could at least claim an equality: they are ducks,
rabbits, kangaroos, lizards, worms, frogs, etc. Their objective
qualities surely were not the origin of the religious sentiments
which they inspired.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER IV</b><br /><br />

<small>TOTEMISM AS AN ELEMENTARY RELIGION</small><br /><br />

<i>History of the Question.&mdash;Method of Treating it</i></h3>


<p>Howsoever opposed their conclusions may seem to be,
the two systems which we have just studied agree upon
one essential point: they state the problem in identical terms.
Both undertake to construct the idea of the divine out of the
sensations aroused in us by certain natural phenomena, either
physical or biological. For the animists it is dreams, for the
naturists, certain cosmic phenomena, which served as the point
of departure for religious evolution. But for both, it is in the
nature, either of man or of the universe, that we must look for
the germ of the grand opposition which separates the profane
from the sacred.</p>

<p>But such an enterprise is impossible: it supposes a veritable
creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. A fact of common experience cannot give
us the idea of something whose characteristic is to be outside
the world of common experience. A man, as he appears to
himself in his dreams, is only a man. Natural forces, as our
senses perceive them, are only natural forces, howsoever great
their intensity may be. Hence comes the common criticism
which we address to both doctrines. In order to explain how
these pretended data of religious thought have been able to
take a sacred character which has no objective foundation, it
would be necessary to admit that a whole world of delusive
representations has superimposed itself upon the other, denatured
it to the point of making it unrecognizable, and substituted
a pure hallucination for reality. Here, it is the illusions
of the dream which brought about this transfiguration; there,
it is the brilliant and vain company of images evoked by the
word. But in one case as in the other, it is necessary to regard
religion as the product of a delirious imagination.</p>

<p>Thus one positive conclusion is arrived at as the result of this
critical examination. Since neither man nor nature have of
themselves a sacred character, they must get it from another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
source. Aside from the human individual and the physical
world, there should be some other reality, in relation to which
this variety of delirium which all religion is in a sense, has a
significance and an objective value. In other words, beyond
those which we have called animistic and naturistic, there
should be another sort of cult, more fundamental and more
primitive, of which the first are only derived forms or particular
aspects.</p>

<p>In fact, this cult does exist: it is the one to which ethnologists
have given the name of totemism.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was only at the end of the eighteenth century that the
word totem appeared in ethnographical literature. It is found
for the first time in the book of an Indian interpreter, J. Long,
which was published in London in 1791.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> For nearly a half a
century, totemism was known only as something exclusively
American.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> It was only in 1841 that Grey, in a passage which
has remained celebrated,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> pointed out the existence of wholly
similar practices in Australia. From that time on, scholars
began to realize that they were in the presence of a system of a
certain generality.</p>

<p>But they saw there only an essentially archaic institution,
an ethnographical curiosity, having no great interest for the
historian. MacLennan was the first who undertook to attach
totemism to the general history of humanity. In a series of
articles in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> he set himself to show that
totemism was not only a religion, but one from which were
derived a multitude of beliefs and practices which are found in
much more advanced religious systems. He even went so far
as to make it the source of all the animal-worshipping and plant-worshipping
cults which are found among ancient peoples.
Certainly this extension of totemism was abusive. The cults
of animals and plants depend upon numerous causes which
cannot be reduced to one, without the error of too great simplicity.
But this error, by its very exaggerations, had at least
the advantage, that it put into evidence the historical importance
of totemism.</p>

<p>Students of American totemism had already known for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
long time that this form of religion was most intimately united
to a determined social organization, that its basis is the division
of the social group into clans.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In 1877, in his <i>Ancient Society</i>,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
Lewis H. Morgan undertook to make a study of it, to determine
its distinctive characteristics, and at the same time to point
out its generality among the Indian tribes of North and Central
America. At nearly the same moment, and even following the
direct suggestion of Morgan, Fison and Howitt<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> established the
existence of the same social system in Australia, as well as its
relations with totemism.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these directing ideas, observations
could be made with better method. The researches which the
American Bureau of Ethnology undertook, played an important
part in the advance of these studies.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> By 1887, the documents
were sufficiently numerous and significant to make Frazer
consider it time to unite them and present them to us in a
systematic form. Such is the object of his little book <i>Totemism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
where the system is studied both as a religion and as a legal
institution. But this study was purely descriptive; no effort
was made to explain totemism<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> or to understand its fundamental
notions.</p>

<p>Robertson Smith is the first who undertook this work of
elaboration. He realized more clearly than any of his predecessors
how rich this crude and confused religion is in germs for
the future. It is true that MacLennan had already connected
it with the great religions of antiquity; but that was merely
because he thought he had found here and there the cult of
animals or plants. Now if we reduce totemism to a sort of
animal or plant worship, we have seen only its most superficial
aspect: we have even misunderstood its real nature. Going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
beyond the mere letter of the totemic beliefs, Smith set himself
to find the fundamental principles upon which they depend.
In his book upon <i>Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> he
had already pointed out that totemism supposes a likeness in
nature, either natural or acquired, of men and animals (or plants).
In his <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> he makes this same idea the
first origin of the entire sacrificial system: it is to totemism that
humanity owes the principle of the communion meal. It is true
that the theory of Smith can now be shown one-sided; it is no
longer adequate for the facts actually known; but for all that,
it contains an ingenious theory and has exercised a most fertile
influence upon the science of religions. The <i>Golden Bough</i><a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> of
Frazer is inspired by these same ideas, for totemism, which
MacLennan had attached to the religions of classical antiquity,
and Smith to the religions of the Semitic peoples, is here connected
to the European folk-lore. The schools of MacLennan
and Morgan are thus united to that of Mannhardt.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>During this time, the American tradition continued to develop
with an independence which it has kept up until very recent
times. Three groups of societies were the special object of the
researches which were concerned with totemism. These are,
first, certain tribes of the North-west, the Tlinkit, the Haida, the
Kwakiutl, the Salish and the Tsimshian; then, the great nation
of the Sioux; and finally, the Pueblo Indians in the south-western
part of the United States. The first were studied principally
by Dall, Krause, Boas, Swanton, Hill Tout; the second
by Dorsey; the last by Mindeleff, Mrs. Stevenson and Cushing.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
But however rich the harvest of facts thus gathered in all parts
of the country may have been, the documents at our disposal
were still fragmentary. Though the American religions contain
numerous traces of totemism, they have passed the stage of real
totemism. On the other hand, observations in Australia had
brought little more than scattered beliefs and isolated rites,
initiation rituals and interdictions relative to totemism. It was
with facts taken from all these sources that Frazer attempted to
draw a picture of totemism in its entirety. Whatever may be
the incontestable merit of the reconstruction undertaken in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
such circumstances, it could not help being incomplete and
hypothetical. A totemic religion in complete action had not yet
been observed.</p>

<p>It is only in very recent years that this serious deficiency has
been repaired. Two observers of remarkable ability, Baldwin
Spencer and F. J. Gillen, discovered<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> in the interior of the
Australian continent a considerable number of tribes whose
basis and unity was founded in totemic beliefs. The results of
their observations have been published in two works, which
have given a new life to the study of totemism. The first of
these, <i>The Native Tribes of Central Australia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> deals with the
more central of these tribes, the Arunta, the Luritcha, and a
little farther to the south, on the shores of Lake Eyre, the
Urabunna. The second, which is entitled <i>The Northern Tribes
of Central Australia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> deals with the societies north of the
Urabunna, occupying the territory between MacDonnell's Range
and Carpenter Gulf. Among the principal of these we may
mention the Unmatjera, the Kaitish, the Warramunga, the
Worgaia, the Tjingilli, the Binbinga, the Walpari, the Gnanji
and finally, on the very shores of the gulf, the Mara and the
Anula.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>More recently, a German missionary, Carl Strehlow, who has
also passed long years in these same Central Australian societies,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
has commenced to publish his own observations on two of these
tribes, the Aranda and the Loritja (the Arunta and Luritcha of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Spencer and Gillen).<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Having well mastered the language
spoken by these peoples,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Strehlow has been able to bring us a
large number of totemic myths and religious songs, which are
given us, for the most part, in the original text. In spite of
some differences of detail which are easily explained and whose
importance has been greatly exaggerated,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> we shall see that
the observations of Strehlow, though completing, making more
precise and sometimes even rectifying those of Spencer and
Gillen, confirm them in all that is essential.</p>

<p>These discoveries have given rise to an abundant literature to
which we shall have occasion to return. The works of Spencer
and Gillen especially have exercised a considerable influence,
not only because they were the oldest, but also because the facts
were there presented in a systematic form, which was of a nature
to give a direction to later studies,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and to stimulate speculation.
Their results were commented upon, discussed and interpreted
in all possible manners. At this same time, Howitt, whose
fragmentary studies were scattered in a number of different
publications,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> undertook to do for the southern tribes what
Spencer and Gillen had done for those of the centre. In his
<i>Native Tribes of South-East Australia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> he gives us a view of the
social organization of the peoples who occupy Southern Australia,
New South Wales, and a good part of Queensland. The progress
thus realized suggested to Frazer the idea of completing his
Totemism by a sort of compendium<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> where would be brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
together all the important documents which are concerned either
with the totemic religion or the family and matrimonial organization
which, rightly or wrongly, is believed to be connected with
this religion. The purpose of this book is not to give us a general
and systematic view of totemism, but rather to put the materials
necessary for a construction of this sort at the disposition of
scholars.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The facts are here arranged in a strictly ethnographical
and geographical order: each continent, and within
the continent, each tribe or ethnic group is studied separately.
Though so extended a study, where so many diverse peoples
are successively passed in review, could hardly be equally
thorough in all its parts, still it is a useful hand-book to consult,
and one which can aid greatly in facilitating researches.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>From this historical r&eacute;sum&eacute; it is clear that Australia is the
most favourable field for the study of totemism, and therefore
we shall make it the principal area of our observations.</p>

<p>In his <i>Totemism</i>, Frazer sought especially to collect all the
traces of totemism which could be found in history or ethnography.
He was thus led to include in his study societies the
nature and degree of whose culture differs most widely: ancient
Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Arabia and Greece,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and the southern Slavs<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> are found
there, side by side with the tribes of Australia and America.
This manner of procedure is not at all surprising for a disciple
of the anthropological school. For this school does not seek
to locate religions in the social environments of which they are
a part,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and to differentiate them according to the different
environments to which they are thus connected. But rather,
as is indicated by the name which it has taken to itself, its purpose
is to go beyond the national and historical differences to the
universal and really human bases of the religious life. It is supposed
that man has a religious nature of himself, in virtue of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
own constitution, and independently of all social conditions, and
they propose to study this.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> For researches of this sort, all
peoples can be called upon equally well. It is true that they
prefer the more primitive peoples, because this fundamental
nature is more apt to be unaltered here; but since it is found
equally well among the most civilized peoples, it is but natural
that they too should be called as witnesses. Consequently, all
those who pass as being not too far removed from the origins,
and who are confusedly lumped together under the rather imprecise
rubric of <i>savages</i>, are put on the same plane and consulted
indifferently. Since from this point of view, facts have an interest
only in proportion to their generality, they consider themselves
obliged to collect as large a number as possible of them; the
circle of comparisons could not become too large.</p>

<p>Our method will not be such a one, for several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, for the sociologist as for the historian, social
facts vary with the social system of which they form a part;
they cannot be understood when detached from it. This is why
two facts which come from two different societies cannot be
profitably compared merely because they seem to resemble each
other; it is necessary that these societies themselves resemble
each other, that is to say, that they be only varieties of the same
species. The comparative method would be impossible, if social
types did not exist, and it cannot be usefully applied except
within a single type. What errors have not been committed for
having neglected this precept! It is thus that facts have been
unduly connected with each other which, in spite of exterior
resemblances, really have neither the same sense nor the same
importance: the primitive democracy and that of to-day, the
collectivism of inferior societies and actual socialistic tendencies,
the monogamy which is frequent in Australian tribes and that
sanctioned by our laws, etc. Even in the work of Frazer such
confusions are found. It frequently happens that he assimilates
simple rites of wild-animal-worship to practices that are really
totemic, though the distance, sometimes very great, which
separates the two social systems would exclude all idea of assimilation.
Then if we do not wish to fall into these same errors,
instead of scattering our researches over all the societies possible,
we must concentrate them upon one clearly determined type.</p>

<p>It is even necessary that this concentration be as close as
possible. One cannot usefully compare facts with which he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
not perfectly well acquainted. But when he undertakes to
include all sorts of societies and civilizations, one cannot know
any of them with the necessary thoroughness; when he assembles
facts from every country in order to compare them, he is obliged
to take them hastily, without having either the means or the
time to carefully criticize them. Tumultuous and summary
comparisons result, which discredit the comparative method
with many intelligent persons. It can give serious results only
when it is applied to so limited a number of societies that each of
them can be studied with sufficient precision. The essential
thing is to choose those where investigations have the greatest
chance to be fruitful.</p>

<p>Also, the value of the facts is much more important than their
number. In our eyes, the question whether totemism has been
more or less universal or not, is quite secondary.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> If it interests
us, it does so before all because in studying it we hope to discover
relations of a nature to make us understand better what religion
is. Now to establish these relations it is neither necessary nor
always useful to heap up numerous experiences upon each other;
it is much more important to have a few that are well studied
and really significant. One single fact may make a law appear,
where a multitude of imprecise and vague observations would
only produce confusion. In every science, the scholar would be
overwhelmed by the facts which present themselves to him, if he
did not make a choice among them. It is necessary that he
distinguish those which promise to be the most instructive, that
he concentrate his attention upon these, and that he temporarily
leave the others to one side.</p>

<p>That is why, with one reservation which will be indicated
below, we propose to limit our research to Australian societies.
They fulfil all the conditions which were just enumerated. They
are perfectly homogeneous, for though it is possible to distinguish
varieties among them, they all belong to one common type.
This homogeneity is even so great that the forms of social organization
are not only the same, but that they are even designated
by identical or equivalent names in a multitude of tribes, sometimes
very distant from each other.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Also, Australian totemism
is the variety for which our documents are the most complete.
Finally, that which we propose to study in this work is the
most primitive and simple religion which it is possible to find.
It is therefore natural that to discover it, we address ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to societies as slightly evolved as possible, for it is evidently
there that we have the greatest chance of finding it and studying
it well. Now there are no societies which present this characteristic
to a higher degree than the Australian ones. Not only is
their civilization most rudimentary&mdash;the house and even the
hut are still unknown&mdash;but also their organization is the most
primitive and simple which is actually known; it is that which
we have elsewhere called <i>organization on a basis of clans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In the
next chapter, we shall have occasion to restate its essential
traits.</p>


<p class="npara">However, though making Australia the principal field of
our research, we think it best not to leave completely aside the
societies where totemism was first discovered, that is to say, the
Indian tribes of North America.</p>

<p>This extension of the field of comparison has nothing about
it which is not legitimate. Undoubtedly these people are more
advanced than those of Australia. Their civilization has become
much more advanced: men there live in houses or under tents,
and there are even fortified villages. The size of the society is
much greater, and centralization, which is completely lacking
in Australia, is beginning to appear there; we find vast confederations,
such as that of the Iroquois, under one central
authority. Sometimes a complicated system of differentiated
classes arranged in a hierarchy is found. However, the essential
lines of the social structure remain the same as those in Australia;
it is always the organization on a basis of clans. Thus we are not
in the presence of two different types, but of two varieties of a
single type, which are still very close to each other. They represent
two successive moments of a single evolution, so their homogeneousness
is still great enough to permit comparisons.</p>

<p>Also, these comparisons may have their utility. Just because
their civilization is more advanced than that of the Australians,
certain phases of the social organization which is common to
both can be studied more easily among the first than among
the second. As long as men are still making their first steps in
the art of expressing their thought, it is not easy for the observer
to perceive that which moves them; for there is nothing to
translate clearly that which passes in these obscure minds which
have only a confused and ephemeral knowledge of themselves.
For example, religious symbols then consist only in formless
combinations of lines and colours, whose sense it is not easy
to divine, as we shall see. There are many gestures and movements
by which interior states express themselves; but being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
essentially ephemeral, they readily elude observation. That is
why totemism was discovered earlier in America than in Australia;
it was much more visible there, though it held relatively less place
in the totality of the religious life. Also, wherever beliefs and
institutions do not take a somewhat definite material form, they
are more liable to change under the influence of the slightest
circumstances, or to become wholly effaced from the memory.
Thus the Australian clans frequently have something floating
and Protean about them, while the corresponding organization
in America has a greater stability and more clearly defined
contours. Thus, though American totemism is further removed
from its origins than that of Australia, still there are important
characteristics of which it has better kept the memory.</p>

<p>In the second place, in order to understand an institution, it
is frequently well to follow it into the advanced stages of its
evolution;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> for sometimes it is only when it is fully developed
that its real signification appears with the greatest clearness. In
this way also, American totemism, since it has a long history
behind it, could serve to clarify certain aspects of Australian
totemism.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> At the same time, it will put us in a better condition
to see how totemism is bound up with the forms which follow,
and to mark its place in the general historical development of
religion.</p>

<p>So in the discussions which follow, we shall not forbid ourselves
the use of certain facts borrowed from the Indian societies of
North America. But we are not going to study American
totemism here;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> such a study must be made directly and by
itself, and cannot be mixed with the one which we are undertaking;
it raises other problems and implies a wholly different
set of special investigations. We shall have recourse to American
facts merely in a supplementary way, and only when they seem
to be able to make us understand Australian facts to advantage.
It is these latter which constitute the real and immediate object
of our researches.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<small>TOTEMIC BELIEFS</small><br /><br />

<i>The Totem as Name and as Emblem</i></h3>


<p>Owing to its nature, our study will include two parts.
Since every religion is made up of intellectual conceptions
and ritual practices, we must deal successively with the beliefs
and rites which compose the totemic religion. These two elements
of the religious life are too closely connected with each other
to allow of any radical separation. In principle, the cult is
derived from the beliefs, yet it reacts upon them; the myth
is frequently modelled after the rite in order to account for it,
especially when its sense is no longer apparent. On the other
hand, there are beliefs which are clearly manifested only through
the rites which express them. So these two parts of our analysis
cannot fail to overlap. However, these two orders of facts are
so different that it is indispensable to study them separately.
And since it is impossible to understand anything about a
religion while unacquainted with the ideas upon which it rests,
we must seek to become acquainted with these latter first
of all.</p>

<p>But it is not our intention to retrace all the speculations into
which the religious thought, even of the Australians alone, has
run. The things we wish to reach are the elementary notions
at the basis of the religion, but there is no need of following them
through all the development, sometimes very confused, which
the mythological imagination of these peoples has given them.
We shall make use of myths when they enable us to understand
these fundamental ideas better, but we shall not make mythology
itself the subject of our studies. In so far as this is a work of art,
it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the simple science of
religions. Also, the intellectual evolution from which it results
is of too great a complexity to be studied indirectly and from a
foreign point of view. It constitutes a very difficult problem
which must be treated by itself, for itself and with a method
peculiar to itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the beliefs upon which totemism rests, the most important
are naturally those concerning the totem; it is with
these that we must begin.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>At the basis of nearly all the Australian tribes we find a group
which holds a preponderating place in the collective life: this is
the clan. Two essential traits characterize it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the individuals who compose it consider
themselves united by a bond of kinship, but one which is of a
very special nature. This relationship does not come from the
fact that they have definite blood connections with one another;
they are relatives from the mere fact that they have the same
name. They are not fathers and mothers, sons or daughters,
uncles or nephews of one another in the sense which we now give
these words; yet they think of themselves as forming a single
family, which is large or small according to the dimensions of
the clan, merely because they are collectively designated by the
same word. When we say that they regard themselves as a
single family, we do so because they recognize duties towards
each other which are identical with those which have always
been incumbent upon kindred: such duties as aid, vengeance,
mourning, the obligation not to marry among themselves, etc.</p>

<p>By this first characteristic, the clan does not differ from the
Roman <i>gens</i> or the Greek &#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;; for this relationship also came
merely from the fact that all the members of the <i>gens</i> had the
same name,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the <i>nomen gentilicium</i>. And in one sense, the <i>gens</i>
is a clan; but it is a variety which should not be confounded
with the Australian clan.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> This latter is distinguished by the
fact that its name is also the name of a determined species of
material things with which it believes that it has very particular
relations, the nature of which we shall presently describe; they
are especially relations of kinship. The species of things which
serves to designate the clan collectively is called its <i>totem</i>. The
totem of the clan is also that of each of its members.</p>

<p>Each clan has its totem, which belongs to it alone; two different
clans of the same tribe cannot have the same. In fact, one is a
member of a clan merely because he has a certain name. All
who bear this name are members of it for that very reason; in
whatever manner they may be spread over the tribal territory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
they all have the same relations of kinship with one another.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Consequently, two groups having the same totem can only be
two sections of the same clan. Undoubtedly, it frequently
happens that all of a clan does not reside in the same locality,
but has representatives in several different places. However,
this lack of a geographical basis does not cause its unity to be
the less keenly felt.</p>

<p>In regard to the word totem, we may say that it is the one
employed by the Ojibway, an Algonquin tribe, to designate the
sort of thing whose name the clan bears.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Although this expression
is not at all Australian,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and is found only in one single society in
America, ethnographers have definitely adopted it, and use it
to denote, in a general way, the system which we are describing.
Schoolcraft was the first to extend the meaning of the word thus
and to speak of a "totemic system."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> This extension, of which
there are examples enough in ethnography, is not without inconveniences.
It is not normal for an institution of this importance
to bear a chance name, taken from a strictly local dialect,
and bringing to mind none of the distinctive characteristics of
the thing it designates. But to-day this way of employing the
word is so universally accepted that it would be an excess of
purism to rise against this usage.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>In a very large proportion of the cases, the objects which
serve as totems belong either to the animal or the vegetable
kingdom, but especially to the former. Inanimate things are
much more rarely employed. Out of more than 500 totemic
names collected by Howitt among the tribes of south-eastern
Australia, there are scarcely forty which are not the names of
plants or animals; these are the clouds, rain, hail, frost, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
moon, the sun, the wind, the autumn, the summer, the winter,
certain stars, thunder, fire, smoke, water or the sea. It is noticeable
how small a place is given to celestial bodies and, more
generally, to the great cosmic phenomena, which were destined
to so great a fortune in later religious development. Among all
the clans of which Howitt speaks, there were only two which
had the moon as totem,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> two the sun,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> three a star,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> three the
thunder,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> two the lightning.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The rain is a single exception; it,
on the contrary, is very frequent.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>These are the totems which can be spoken of as normal. But
totemism has its abnormalities as well. It sometimes happens
that the totem is not a whole object, but the part of an object.
This fact appears rather rarely in Australia;<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Howitt cites only
one example.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> However, it may well be that this is found with
a certain frequency in the tribes where the totemic groups are
excessively subdivided; it might be said that the totems had to
break themselves up in order to be able to furnish names to these
numerous divisions. This is what seems to have taken place
among the Arunta and the Loritja. Strehlow has collected 442
totems in these two societies, of which many are not an animal
species, but some particular organ of the animal of the species,
such as the tail or stomach of an opossum, the fat of the kangaroo,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that normally the totem is not an individual,
but a species or a variety: it is not such and such a kangaroo or
crow, but the kangaroo or crow in general. Sometimes, however,
it is a particular object. First of all, this is necessarily the case
when the thing serving as totem is unique in its class, as the sun,
the moon, such or such a constellation, etc. It also happens that
clans take their names from certain geographical irregularities or
depressions of the land, from a certain ant-hill, etc. It is true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
that we have only a small number of examples of this in Australia;
but Strehlow does mention some.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But the very causes which
have given rise to these abnormal totems show that they are of a
relatively recent origin. In fact, what has made certain geographical
features of the land become totems is that a mythical
ancestor is supposed to have stopped there or to have performed
some act of his legendary life there.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> But at the same time, these
ancestors are represented in the myths as themselves belonging
to clans which had perfectly regular totems, that is to say, ones
taken from the animal or vegetable kingdoms. Therefore, the
totemic names thus commemorating the acts and performances
of these heroes cannot be primitive; they belong to a form of
totemism that is already derived and deviated. It is even
permissible to ask if the meteorological totems have not
a similar origin; for the sun, the moon and the stars are
frequently identified with the ancestors of the mythological
epoch.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, but no less exceptionally, it is an ancestor or a group
of ancestors which serves as totem directly. In this case, the clan
takes its name, not from a thing or a species of real things, but
from a purely mythical being. Spencer and Gillen had already
mentioned two or three totems of this sort. Among the Warramunga
and among the Tjingilli there are clans which bear the name
of an ancestor named Thaballa who seems to be gaiety incarnate.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Another Warramunga clan bears the name of a huge fabulous
serpent named Wollunqua, from which the clan considers itself
descended.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> We owe other similar facts to Strehlow.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In any
case, it is easy enough to see what probably took place. Under
the influence of diverse causes and by the very development of
mythological thought, the collective and impersonal totem
became effaced before certain mythical personages who advanced
to the first rank and became totems themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Howsoever interesting these different irregularities may be,
they contain nothing which forces us to modify our definition
of a totem. They are not, as has sometimes been believed,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
different varieties of totems which are more or less irreducible
into each other or into the normal totem, such as we have defined
it. They are merely secondary and sometimes even aberrant
forms of a single notion which is much more general, and there is
every ground for believing it the more primitive.</p>


<p class="npara">The manner in which the name is acquired is more important
for the organization and recruiting of the clan than for religion;
it belongs to the sociology of the family rather than to religious
sociology.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> So we shall confine ourselves to indicating summarily
the most essential principles which regulate the matter.</p>

<p>In the different tribes, three different systems are in use.</p>

<p>In a great number, or it might even be said, in the greater
number of the societies, the child takes the totem of its mother,
by right of birth: this is what happens among the Dieri and the
Urabunna of the centre of Southern Australia; the Wotjobaluk
and the Gournditch-Mara of Victoria; the Kamilaroi, the Wiradjuri,
the Wonghibon and the Euahlayi of New South Wales; and
the Wakelbura, the Pitta-Pitta and the Kurnandaburi of Queensland,
to mention only the most important names. In this case,
owing to a law of exogamy, the mother is necessarily of a different
totem from her husband, and on the other hand, as she lives in
his community, the members of a single totem are necessarily
dispersed in different localities according to the chances of their
marriages. As a result, the totemic group lacks a territorial
base.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the totem is transmitted in the paternal line. In
this case, if the child remains with his father, the local group is
largely made up of people belonging to a single totem; only the
married women there represent foreign totems. In other words,
each locality has its particular totem. Up until recent times,
this scheme of organization was found in Australia only among
the tribes where totemism was in decadence, such as the Narrinyeri,
where the totem has almost no religious character at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
any more.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It was therefore possible to believe that there was
a close connection between the totemic system and descent in
the uterine line. But Spencer and Gillen have observed, in the
northern part of central Australia, a whole group of tribes where
the totemic religion is still practised but where the transmission
of the totem is in the paternal line: these are the Warramunga,
the Quanji, the Umbia, the Binbinga, the Mara and the Anula.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Finally, a third combination is the one observed among the
Arunta and Loritja. Here the totem of the child is not necessarily
either that of the mother or that of the father; it is that of a
mythical ancestor who came, by processes which the observers
recount in different ways,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and mysteriously fecundated the
mother at the moment of conception. A special process makes
it possible to learn which ancestor it was and to which totemic
group he belonged.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> But since it was only chance which determined
that this ancestor happened to be near the mother,
rather than another, the totem of the child is thus found to
depend finally upon fortuitous circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>


<p class="npara">Outside of and above the totems of clans there are totems of
phratries which, though not differing from the former in nature,
must none the less be distinguished from them.</p>

<p>A phratry is a group of clans which are united to each other
by particular bonds of fraternity. Ordinarily the Australian
tribe is divided into two phratries between which the different
clans are distributed. Of course there are some tribes where this
organization has disappeared, but everything leads us to believe
that it was once general. In any case, there are no tribes in
Australia where the number of phratries is greater than two.</p>

<p>Now in nearly all the cases where the phratries have a name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
whose meaning has been established, this name is that of an
animal; it would therefore seem that it is a totem. This has
been well demonstrated in a recent work by A. Lang.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Thus,
among the Gournditch (Victoria), the phratries are called
Krokitch and Kaputch; the former of the words designates the
white cockatoo and the latter the black cockatoo.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The same
expressions are found again among the Buandik and the Wotjobaluk.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
Among the Wurunjerri, the names employed are Bunjil
and Waang, which designate the eagle-hawk and the crow.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
The words Mukwara and Kilpara are used for the same purpose
in a large number of tribes of New South Wales;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> they designate
the same birds.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> It is also the eagle-hawk and the crow which
have given their names to the two phratries of the Ngarigo and
the Wolgal.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Among the Kuinmurbura, it is the white cockatoo
and the crow.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Many other examples might be cited. Thus we
are led to regard the phratry as an ancient clan which has been
dismembered; the actual clans are the product of this dismemberment,
and the solidarity which unites them is a souvenir of their
primitive unity.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> It is true that in certain tribes, the phratries
no longer have special names, as it seems; in others where these
names exist, their meaning is no longer known, even to the
members. But there is nothing surprising in this. The phratries
are certainly a primitive institution, for they are everywhere in a
state of regression; their descendants the clans have passed to
the first rank. So it is but natural that the names which they
bore should have been effaced from memory little by little,
when they were no longer understood; for they must belong
to a very archaic language no longer in use. This is proved by
the fact that in many cases where we know the animal whose
name the phratry bears, the word designating this animal in the
current language is very different from the one employed here.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the totem of the phratry and the totems of the clans
there exists a sort of relation of subordination. In fact, in
principle each clan belongs to one and only one phratry; it is
very exceptional that it has representatives in the other phratry.
This is not met with at all except among certain central tribes,
notably the Arunta;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> also even where, owing to disturbing
influences, overlappings of this sort have taken place, the great
part of the clan is included entirely within one or the other of the
two groups of the tribe; only a small minority is to be found in
the other one.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> As a rule then, the two phratries do not overlap
each other; consequently, the list of totems which an individual
may have is predetermined by the phratry to which he belongs.
In other words, the phratry is like a species of which the clans
are varieties. We shall presently see that this comparison is not
purely metaphorical.</p>


<p class="npara">In addition to the phratries and clans, another secondary group
is frequently met with in Australian societies, which is not without
a certain individuality: these are the matrimonial classes.</p>

<p>By this name they designate certain subdivisions of the
phratry, whose number varies with the tribe: there are sometimes
two and sometimes four per phratry.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Their recruiting and
operation are regulated by the two following principles. In the
first place, each generation in a phratry belongs to different
clans from the immediately preceding one. Thus, when there
are only two classes per phratry, they necessarily alternate
with each other every generation. The children make up the
class of which their parents are not members; but grandchildren
are of the same class as their grandparents. Thus, among the
Kamilaroi, the Kupathin phratry has two classes, Ippai and
Kumbo; the Dilby phratry, two others which are called Murri
and Kubbi. As descent is in the uterine line, the child is in the
phratry of its mother; if she is a Kupathin, the child will be
one also. But if she is of the Ippai class, he will be a Kumbo;
if the child is a girl, her children will again be in the Ippai class.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise, the children of the women of the Murri class will be
in the Kubbi class, and the children of the Kubbi women will be
Murri again. When there are four classes per phratry, instead of
two, the system is naturally more complex, but the principle is
the same. The four classes form two couples of two classes each,
and these two classes alternate with each other every generation
in the manner just indicated. Secondly, the members of one
class can in principle<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> marry into only one of the classes of the
other phratry. The Ippai must marry into the Kubbi class and
the Murri into the Kumbo class. It is because this organization
profoundly affects matrimonial relations that we give the group
the name of matrimonial class.</p>

<p>Now it may be asked whether these classes do not sometimes
have totems like the phratries and clans.</p>

<p>This question is raised by the fact that in certain tribes of
Queensland, each matrimonial class has dietetic restrictions that
are peculiar to it. The individuals who compose it must abstain
from eating the flesh of certain animals which the others may
consume freely.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Are these animals not totems?</p>

<p>But dietetic restrictions are not the characteristic marks of
totemism. The totem is a name first of all, and then, as we shall
see, an emblem. Now in the societies of which we just spoke,
there are no matrimonial classes which bear the name of an
animal or plant, or which have an emblem.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Of course it is
possible that these restrictions are indirectly derived from
totemism. It might be supposed that the animals which these
interdictions protect were once the totems of clans which have
since disappeared, while the matrimonial classes remained. It
is certain that they have a force of endurance which the clans
do not have. Then these interdictions, deprived of their original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
field, may have spread themselves out over the entire class,
since there were no other groups to which they could be attached.
But it is clear that if this regulation was born of totemism, it
represents only an enfeebled and denatured form of it.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>All that has been said of the totem in Australian societies is
equally applicable to the Indian tribes of North America. The
only difference is that among these latter, the totemic organization
has a strictness of outline and a stability which are not found in
Australia. The Australian clans are not only very numerous,
but in a single tribe their number is almost unlimited. Observers
cite some of them as examples, but without ever succeeding in
giving us a complete list. This is because the list is never definitely
terminated. The same process of dismemberment which broke
up the original phratries and give birth to clans properly so-called
still continues within these latter; as a result of this progressive
crumbling, a clan frequently has only a very small effective
force.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> In America, on the contrary, the totemic system has
better defined forms. Although the tribes there are considerably
larger on the average, the clans are less numerous. A single
tribe rarely has more than a dozen of them,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and frequently less;
each of them is therefore a much more important group. But
above all, their number is fixed; they know their exact number,
and they it tell to us.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>This difference is due to the superiority of their social economy.
From the moment when these tribes were observed for the first
time, the social groups were strongly attached to the soil, and
consequently better able to resist the decentralizing forces which
assailed them. At the same time, the society had too keen a
sentiment of its unity to remain unconscious of itself and of the
parts out of which it was composed. The example of America
thus enables us to explain even better the organization at the
base of the clans. We would take a mistaken view, if we judged
this only on the present conditions in Australia. In fact, it is in
a state of change and dissolution there, which is not at all normal;
it is much rather the product of a degeneration which we see,
due both to the natural decay of time and the disorganizing effect
of the whites. To be sure, it is hardly probable that the Australian
clans ever had the dimensions and solid structure of the American
ones. But there must have been a time when the distance between
them was less considerable than it is to-day, for the American
societies would never have succeeded in making so solid a
structure if the clans had always been of so fluid and inconsistent
a nature.</p>

<p>This greater stability has even enabled the archaic system of
phratries to maintain itself in America with a clearness and a
relief no longer to be found in Australia. We have just seen that
in the latter continent the phratry is everywhere in a state of
decadence; very frequently it is nothing more than an anonymous
group; when it has a name, this is either no longer understood,
or in any case, it cannot mean a great deal to the native,
since it is borrowed from a foreign language, or from one no
longer spoken. Thus we have been able to infer the existence of
totems for phratries only from a few survivals, which, for the
most part, are so slightly marked that they have escaped the
attention of many observers. In certain parts of America, on
the contrary, this institution has retained its primitive importance.
The tribes of the North-west coast, the Tlinkit and the Haida
especially, have now attained a relatively advanced civilization;
yet they are divided into two phratries which are subdivided into
a certain number of clans: the phratries of the Crow and the
Wolf among the Tlinkit,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of the Eagle and the Crow among the
Haida.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> And this division is not merely nominal; it corresponds
to an ever-existing state of tribal customs and is deeply marked
with the tribal life. The moral distance separating the clans is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
very slight in comparison with that separating the phratries.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
The name of each is not a word whose sense is forgotten or only
vaguely known; it is a totem in the full sense of the term; they
have all its essential attributes, such as will be described below.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
Consequently, upon this point also, American tribes must not be
neglected, for we can study the totems of phratries directly there,
while Australia offers only obscure vestiges of them.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>But the totem is not merely a name; it is an emblem, a
veritable coat-of-arms whose analogies with the arms of heraldry
have often been remarked. In speaking of the Australians, Grey
says, "each family adopt an animal or vegetable as their crest
and sign,"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and what Grey calls a family is incontestably a
clan. Also Fison and Howitt say, "the Australian divisions
show that the totem is, in the first place, the badge of a group."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Schoolcraft says the same thing about the totems of the Indians
of North America. "The totem is in fact a design which corresponds
to the heraldic emblems of civilized nations, and
each person is authorized to bear it as a proof of the identity
of the family to which it belongs. This is proved by the real
etymology of the word, which is derived from <i>dodaim</i>, which
means village or the residence of a family group."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Thus when
the Indians entered into relations with the Europeans and contracts
were formed between them, it was with its totem that
each clan sealed the treaties thus concluded.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The nobles of the feudal period carved, engraved and designed
in every way their coats-of-arms upon the walls of their castles,
their arms, and every sort of object that belonged to them; the
blacks of Australia and the Indians of North America do the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
same thing with their totems. The Indians who accompanied
Samuel Hearne painted their totems on their shields before going
into battle.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> According to Charlevoix, in time of war, certain
tribes of Indians had veritable ensigns, made of bits of bark
fastened to the end of a pole, upon which the totems were represented.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
Among the Tlinkit, when a conflict breaks out between
two clans, the champions of the two hostile groups wear helmets
over their heads, upon which are painted their respective totems.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
Among the Iroquois, they put the skin of the animal which
serves as totem upon each wigwam, as a mark of the clan.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
According to another observer, the animal was stuffed and set
up before the door.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Among the Wyandot, each clan has its
own ornaments and its distinctive paintings.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Among the
Omaha, and among the Sioux generally, the totem is painted
on the tent.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Wherever the society has become sedentary, where the tent is
replaced by the house, and where the plastic arts are more
fully developed, the totem is engraved upon the woodwork
and upon the walls. This is what happens, for example, among
the Haida, the Tsimshian, the Salish and the Tlinkit. "A
very particular ornament of the house, among the Tlinkit,"
says Krause, "is the totemic coat-of-arms." Animal forms,
sometimes combined with human forms, are engraved upon
the posts at the sides of the door of entry, which are as high
as 15 yards; they are generally painted with very bright colours.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
However, these totemic decorations are not very numerous
in the Tlinkit village; they are found almost solely before the
houses of the chiefs and rich men. They are much more frequent
in the neighbouring tribe of the Haida; here there are always
several for each house.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> With its many sculptured posts arising
on every hand, sometimes to a great height, a Haida village
gives the impression of a sacred city, all bristling with belfries
or little minarets.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Among the Salish, the totem is frequently
represented upon the interior walls of the house.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Elsewhere, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is found upon the canoes, the utensils of every sort and the
funeral piles.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The preceding examples are taken exclusively from the Indians
of North America. This is because sculpture, engravings and
permanent figurations are not possible except where the technique
of the plastic arts has reached a degree of perfection to which
the Australian tribes have not yet attained. Consequently the
totemic representations of the sort which we just mentioned are
rarer and less apparent in Australia than in America. However,
cases of them are cited. Among the Warramunga, at the end of
the burial ceremonies, the bones of the dead man are interred,
after they have been dried and reduced to powder; beside the
place where they are deposited, a figure representing the
totem is traced upon the ground.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Among the Mara and the
Anula, the body is placed in a piece of hollow wood decorated
with designs characteristic of the totem.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> In New South Wales,
Oxley found engravings upon the trees near the tomb where a
native was buried<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> to which Brough Smyth attributes a totemic
character. The natives of the Upper Darling carve totemic
images upon their shields.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> According to Collins, nearly all the
utensils are covered with ornaments which probably have the
same significance; figures of the same sort are found upon the
rocks.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> These totemic designs may even be more frequent than
it seems, for, owing to reasons which will be discussed below, it
is not always easy to see what their real meaning is.</p>


<p class="npara">These different facts give us an idea of the considerable place
held by the totem in the social life of the primitives. However,
up to the present, it has appeared to us as something relatively
outside of the man, for it is only upon external things that we
have seen it represented. But totemic images are not placed
only upon the walls of their houses, the sides of their canoes,
their arms, their utensils and their tombs; they are also found
on the bodies of the men. They do not put their coat-of-arms
merely upon the things which they possess, but they put it upon
their persons; they imprint it upon their flesh, it becomes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
part of them, and this world of representations is even by far
the more important one.</p>

<p>In fact, it is a very general rule that the members of each
clan seek to give themselves the external aspect of their totem.
At certain religious festivals among the Tlinkit, the person who
is to direct the ceremonies wears a garment which represents,
either wholly or in part, the body of the animal whose name he
bears.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> These same usages are also found in all the North-West
of America.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> They are found again among the Minnitaree, when
they go into combat,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and among the Indians of the Pueblos.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Elsewhere, when the totem is a bird, men wear the feathers of this
bird on their heads.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Among the Iowa, each clan has a special
fashion of cutting the hair. In the Eagle clan, two large tufts
are arranged on the front of the head, while there is another
one behind; in the Buffalo clan, they are arranged in the form
of horns.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Among the Omaha, analogous arrangements are
found: each clan has its own head-dress. In the Turtle clan, for
example, the hair is all shaved off, except six bunches, two on
each side of the head, one in front, and one behind, in such a
way as to imitate the legs, the head and the tail of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>But it is more frequently upon the body itself that the totemic
mark is stamped: for this is a way of representation within the
capacity of even the least advanced societies. It has sometimes
been asked whether the common rite of knocking out a young
man's two upper teeth at the age of puberty does not have the
object of reproducing the form of the totem. The fact is not
established, but it is worth mentioning that the natives themselves
sometimes explain the custom thus. For example, among the
Arunta, the extraction of teeth is practised only in the clans of
the rain and of water; now according to tradition, the object
of this operation is to make their faces look like certain black
clouds with light borders which are believed to announce the
speedy arrival of rain, and which are therefore considered things
of the same family.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> This is a proof that the native himself is
conscious that the object of these deformations is to give him,
at least conventionally, the aspect of his totem. Among these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
same Arunta, in the course of the rites of sub-incision, certain
gashes are cut upon the sisters and the future wife of the novice;
scars result from these, whose form is also represented upon a
certain sacred object of which we shall speak presently and which
is called the <i>churinga</i>; as we shall see, the lines thus drawn
upon the <i>churinga</i> are emblematic of the totem.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Among the
Kaitish, the euro is believed to be closely connected with the
rain;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> the men of the rain clan wear little ear-rings made of
euro teeth.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Among the Yerkla, during the initiation the young
man is given a certain number of slashes which leave scars; the
number and form of these varies with the totems.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> An informer
of Fison mentions the same fact in the tribes observed by him.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
According to Howitt, a relationship of the same sort exists
among the Dieri between certain arrangements of scars and the
water totem.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Among the Indians of the North-West, it is a
very general custom for them to tattoo themselves with the
totem.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>But even if the tattooings which are made by mutilations or
scars do not always have a totemic significance,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> it is different
with simple designs drawn upon the body: they are generally
representations of the totem. It is true that the native does not
carry them every day. When he is occupied with purely economic
occupations, or when the small family groups scatter to hunt or
fish, he does not bother with all this paraphernalia, which is
quite complicated. But when the clans unite to live a common
life and to assist at the religious ceremonies together, then he
must adorn himself. As we shall see, each of the ceremonies
concerns a particular totem, and in theory the rites which are
connected with a totem can be performed only by the men of
that totem. Now those who perform,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> who take the part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
officiants, and sometimes even those who assist as spectators,
always have designs representing the totem on their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
One of the principal rites of initiation, by which a young man
enters into the religious life of the tribe, consists in painting the
totemic symbol on his body.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> It is true that among the Arunta
the design thus traced does not always and necessarily represent
the totem of the initiated;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> but these are exceptions, due,
undoubtedly, to the disturbed state of the totemic organization
of this tribe.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Also, even among the Arunta, at the most solemn
moment of the initiation, which is its crown and consecration,
when the neophyte is allowed to enter the sanctuary where all
the sacred objects belonging to the clan are preserved, an
emblematic painting is placed upon him; this time, it is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
totem of the young man which is thus represented.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The bonds
which unite the individual to his totem are even so strong that
in the tribes on the North-west coast of North America, the
emblem of the clan is painted not only upon the living but also
upon the dead: before a corpse is interred, they put the totemic
mark upon it.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>These totemic decorations enable us to see that the totem is
not merely a name and an emblem. It is in the course of the
religious ceremonies that they are employed; they are a part
of the liturgy; so while the totem is a collective label, it also
has a religious character. In fact, it is in connection with it,
that things are classified as sacred or profane. It is the very
type of sacred thing.</p>

<p>The tribes of Central Australia, especially the Arunta, the
Loritja, the Kaitish, the Unmatjera, and the Ilpirra,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> make constant
use of certain instruments in their rites which are called the
<i>churinga</i> by the Arunta, according to Spencer and Gillen, or the
<i>tjurunga</i>, according to Strehlow.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> They are pieces of wood or
bits of polished stone, of a great variety of forms, but generally
oval or oblong.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Each totemic group has a more or less important
collection of these. <i>Upon each of these is engraved a design
representing the totem of this same group.</i><a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> A certain number of
the churinga have a hole at one end, through which goes a thread
made of human hair or that of an opossum. Those which are
made of wood and are pierced in this way serve for exactly the
same purposes as those instruments of the cult to which English
ethnographers have given the name of "bull-roarers." By
means of the thread by which they are suspended, they are
whirled rapidly in the air in such a way as to produce a sort of
humming identical with that made by the toys of this name
still used by our children; this deafening noise has a ritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
significance and accompanies all ceremonies of any importance.
These sorts of churinga are real bull-roarers. But there are
others which are not made of wood and are not pierced; consequently
they cannot be employed in this way. Nevertheless,
they inspire the same religious sentiments.</p>

<p>In fact, every churinga, for whatever purpose it may be
employed, is counted among the eminently sacred things; there
are none which surpass it in religious dignity. This is indicated
even by the word which is used to designate them. It is not
only a substantive but also an adjective meaning sacred. Also,
among the several names which each Arunta has, there is one so
sacred that it must not be revealed to a stranger; it is pronounced
but rarely, and then in a low voice and a sort of mysterious
murmur. Now this name is called the <i>aritna churinga</i> (aritna
means name).<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In general, the word churinga is used to designate
all ritual acts; for example, <i>ilia churinga</i> signifies the cult of the
emu.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Churinga, when used substantively, therefore designates
the thing whose essential characteristic is sacredness. Profane
persons, that is to say, women and young men not yet initiated
into the religious life, may not touch or even see the churinga;
they are only allowed to look at it from a distance, and even
this is only on rare occasions.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>The churinga are piously kept in a special place, which the
Arunta call the <i>ertnatulunga</i>.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> This is a cave or a sort of cavern
hidden in a deserted place. The entrance is carefully closed by
means of stones so cleverly placed that a stranger going past
it could not suspect that the religious treasury of the clan was
so near to him. The sacred character of the churinga is so great
that it communicates itself to the locality where they are stored:
the women and the uninitiated cannot approach it. It is only
after their initiation is completely finished that the young men
have access to it: there are some who are not esteemed worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of this favour except after years of trial.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The religious nature
radiates to a distance and communicates itself to all the surroundings:
everything near by participates in this same nature
and is therefore withdrawn from profane touch. Is one man
pursued by another? If he succeeds in reaching the ertnatulunga,
he is saved; he cannot be seized there.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Even a wounded animal
which takes refuge there must be respected.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Quarrels are forbidden
there. It is a place of peace, as is said in the Germanic
societies; it is a sanctuary of the totemic group, it is a veritable
place of asylum.</p>

<p>But the virtues of the churinga are not manifested merely
by the way in which it keeps the profane at a distance. If it is
thus isolated, it is because it is something of a high religious
value whose loss would injure the group and the individuals
severely. It has all sorts of marvellous properties: by contact
it heals wounds, especially those resulting from circumcision;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
it has the same power over sickness;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> it is useful for making
the beard grow;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> it confers important powers over the totemic
species, whose normal reproduction it ensures;<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> it gives men
force, courage and perseverance, while, on the other hand, it
depresses and weakens their enemies. This latter belief is so
firmly rooted that when two combatants stand pitted against
one another, if one sees that the other has brought churinga
against him, he loses confidence and his defeat is certain.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Thus
there is no ritual instrument which has a more important place
in the religious ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> By means of various sorts of anointings,
their powers are communicated either to the officiants or
to the assistants; to bring this about, they are rubbed over the
members and stomach of the faithful after being covered with
grease;<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> or sometimes they are covered with a down which
flies away and scatters itself in every direction when they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
whirled; this a way of disseminating the virtues which are in
them.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>But they are not useful merely to individuals; the fate of the
clan as a whole is bound up with theirs. Their loss is a disaster;
it is the greatest misfortune which can happen to the group.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
Sometimes they leave the ertnatulunga, for example when they
are loaned to other groups.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Then follows a veritable public
mourning. For two weeks, the people of the totem weep and
lament, covering their bodies with white clay just as they do
when they have lost a relative.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> And the churinga are not left
at the free disposition of everybody; the ertnatulunga where
they are kept is placed under the control of the chief of the
group. It is true that each individual has special rights to some
of them;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> yet, though he is their proprietor in a sense, he
cannot make use of them except with the consent and under
the direction of the chief. It is a collective treasury; it is the
sacred ark of the clan.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The devotion of which they are the
object shows the high price that is attached to them. The
respect with which they are handled is shown by the solemnity
of the movements.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> They are taken care of, they are greased,
rubbed, polished, and when they are moved from one locality to
another, it is in the midst of ceremonies which bear witness to
the fact that this displacement is regarded as an act of the highest
importance.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Now in themselves, the churinga are objects of wood and
stone like all others; they are distinguished from profane
things of the same sort by only one particularity: this is that
the totemic mark is drawn or engraved upon them. So it is
this mark and this alone which gives them their sacred character.
It is true that according to Spencer and Gillen, the churinga
serve as the residence of an ancestor's soul and that it is the
presence of this soul which confers these properties.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
declaring this interpretation inexact, Strehlow, in his turn,
proposes another which does not differ materially from the other:
he claims that the churinga are considered the image of the
ancestor's body, or the body itself.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> So, in any case, it would be
sentiments inspired by the ancestor which fix themselves upon
the material object, and convert it into a sort of fetish. But in the
first place, both conceptions,&mdash;which, by the way, scarcely differ
except in the letter of the myth,&mdash;have obviously been made up
afterwards, to account for the sacred character of the churinga.
In the constitution of these pieces of wood and bits of stone,
and in their external appearance, there is nothing which predestines
them to be considered the seat of an ancestral soul, or
the image of his body. So if men have imagined this myth, it
was in order to explain the religious respect which these things
inspired in them, and the respect was not determined by the
myth. This explanation, like so many mythological explanations,
resolves the question only by repeating it in slightly different
terms; for saying that the churinga is sacred and saying that it
has such and such a relation with a sacred being, is merely to
proclaim the same fact in two different ways; it is not accounting
for them. Moreover, according to the avowal of Spencer and
Gillen, there are some churinga among the Arunta which are made
by the old men of the group, to the knowledge of and before the
eyes of all;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> these obviously do not come from the great ancestors.
However, except for certain differences of degree, they have the
same power as the others and are preserved in the same manner.
Finally, there are whole tribes where the churinga is never
associated with a spirit.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Its religious nature comes to it, then,
from some other source, and whence could it come, if not from
the totemic stamp which it bears? It is to this image, therefore,
that the demonstrations of the rite are really addressed; it is
this which sanctifies the object upon which it is carved.</p>

<p>Among the Arunta and the neighbouring tribes, there are two
other liturgical instruments closely connected with the totem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and the churinga itself, which ordinarily enters into their composition:
they are the <i>nurtunja</i> and the <i>waninga</i>.</p>

<p>The nurtunja,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> which is found among the northern Arunta
and their immediate neighbours,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> is made up principally of a
vertical support which is either a single lance, or several lances
united into a bundle, or of a simple pole.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Bunches of grass are
fastened all around it by means of belts or little cords made of
hair. Above this, down is placed, arranged either in circles or in
parallel lines which run from the top to the bottom of the support.
The top is decorated with the plumes of an eagle-hawk. This is
only the most general and typical form; in particular cases, it
has all sorts of variations.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The waninga, which is found only among the southern Arunta,
the Urabunna and the Loritja, has no one unique model either.
Reduced to its most essential elements, it too consists in a vertical
support, formed by a long stick or by a lance several yards high,
with sometimes one and sometimes two cross-pieces.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In the
former case, it has the appearance of a cross. Cords made either
of human hair or opossum or bandicoot fur diagonally cross the
space included between the arms of the cross and the extremities
of the central axis; as they are quite close to each other, they
form a network in the form of a lozenge. When there are two
cross-bars, these cords go from one to the other and from these
to the top and bottom of the support. They are sometimes
covered with a layer of down, thick enough to conceal the foundation.
Thus the waninga has the appearance of a veritable flag.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Now the nurtunja and the waninga, which figure in a multitude
of important rites, are the object of a religious respect quite like
that inspired by the churinga. The process of their manufacture
and erection is conducted with the greatest solemnity. Fixed in
the earth, or carried by an officiant, they mark the central point
of the ceremony: it is about them that the dances take place
and the rites are performed. In the course of the initiation, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
novice is led to the foot of a nurtunja erected for the occasion.
Someone says to him, "There is the nurtunja of your father;
many young men have already been made by it." After that,
the initiate must kiss the nurtunja.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> By this kiss, he enters
into relations with the religious principle which resides there;
it is a veritable communion which should give the young man
the force required to support the terrible operation of sub-incision.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
The nurtunja also plays a considerable r&ocirc;le in the mythology of
these societies. The myths relate that in the fabulous times of
the great ancestors, the territory of the tribe was overrun in
every direction by companies composed exclusively of individuals
of the same totem.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Each of these troops had a nurtunja with
it. When it stopped to camp, before scattering to hunt, the
members fixed their nurtunja in the ground, from the top of
which their churinga was suspended.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> That is equivalent to
saying that they confided the most precious things they had to
it. It was at the same time a sort of standard which served as a
rallying-centre for the group. One cannot fail to be struck by
the analogies between the nurtunja and the sacred post of the
Omaha.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Now its sacred character can come from only one cause: that
is that it represents the totem materially. The vertical lines or
rings of down which cover it, and even the cords of different
colours which fasten the arms of the waninga to the central
axis, are not arranged arbitrarily, according to the taste of the
makers; they must conform to a type strictly determined by
tradition which, in the minds of the natives, represents the
totem.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Here we cannot ask, as we did in the case of the churinga,
whether the veneration accorded to this instrument of the cult
is not merely the reflex of that inspired by the ancestors; for it
is a rule that each nurtunja and each waninga last only during
the ceremony where they are used. They are made all over
again every time that it is necessary, and when the rite is once
accomplished, they are stripped of their ornaments and the
elements out of which they are made are scattered.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> They are
nothing more than images&mdash;and temporary images at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&mdash;of
the totem, and consequently it is on this ground, and on this
ground alone, that they play a religious r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>So the churinga, the nurtunja and the waninga owe their
religious nature solely to the fact that they bear the totemic
emblem. It is the emblem that is sacred. It keeps this character,
no matter where it may be represented. Sometimes it is painted
upon rocks; these paintings are called <i>churinga ilkinia</i>, sacred
drawings.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The decorations with which the officiants and
assistants at the religious ceremonies adorn themselves have
the same name: women and children may not see them.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In the
course of certain rites, the totem is drawn upon the ground.
The way in which this is done bears witness to the sentiments
inspired by this design, and the high value attributed to it; it
is traced upon a place that has been previously sprinkled, and
saturated with human blood,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and we shall presently see that
the blood is in itself a sacred liquid, serving for pious uses only.
When the design has been made, the faithful remain seated on
the ground before it, in an attitude of the purest devotion.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> If
we give the word a sense corresponding to the mentality of the
primitive, we may say that they adore it. This enables us to
understand how the totemic blazon has remained something very
precious for the Indians of North America: it is always surrounded
with a sort of religious halo.</p>


<p class="npara">But if we are seeking to understand how it comes that these
totemic representations are so sacred, it is not without interest
to see what they consist in.</p>

<p>Among the Indians of North America, they are painted,
engraved or carved images which attempt to reproduce as faithfully
as possible the external aspect of the totemic animal. The
means employed are those which we use to-day in similar circumstances,
except that they are generally cruder. But it is not the
same in Australia, and it is in the Australian societies that
we must seek the origin of these representations. Although the
Australian may show himself sufficiently capable of imitating
the forms of things in a rudimentary way,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> sacred representations
generally seem to show no ambitions in this line: they consist
essentially in geometrical designs drawn upon the churinga, the
nurtunga, rocks, the ground, or the human body. They are
either straight or curved lines, painted in different ways,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the whole having only a conventional meaning. The connection
between the figure and the thing represented is so remote and
indirect that it cannot be seen, except when it is pointed out.
Only the members of the clan can say what meaning is attached
to such and such combinations of lines.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Men and women are
generally represented by semicircles, and animals by whole
circles or spirals,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> the tracks of men or animals by lines of points,
etc. The meaning of the figures thus obtained is so arbitrary
that a single design may have two different meanings for the
men of two different totems, representing one animal here, and
another animal or plant there. This is perhaps still more apparent
with the nurtunja and waninga. Each of them represents a
different totem. But the few and simple elements which enter
into their composition do not allow a great variety of combinations.
The result is that two nurtunja may have exactly the
same appearance, and yet express two things as different as a
gum tree and an emu.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> When a nurtunja is made, it is given a
meaning which it keeps during the whole ceremony, but which,
in the last resort, is fixed by convention.</p>

<p>These facts prove that if the Australian is so strongly inclined
to represent his totem, it is in order not to have a portrait of it
before his eyes which would constantly renew the sensation of
it; it is merely because he feels the need of representing the
idea which he forms of it by means of material and external
signs, no matter what these signs may be. We are not yet ready
to attempt to understand what has thus caused the primitive
to write his idea of his totem upon his person and upon different
objects, but it is important to state at once the nature of the
need which has given rise to these numerous representations.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER II</b><br /><br />

<small>TOTEMIC BELIEFS&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

<i>The Totemic Animal and Man</i></h3>


<p>But totemic images are not the only sacred things. There
are real things which are also the object of rites, because
of the relations which they have with the totem: before all
others, are the beings of the totemic species and the members
of the clan.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>First of all, since the designs which represent the totem arouse
religious sentiments, it is natural that the things whose aspect
these designs reproduce should have this same property, at least
to a certain degree.</p>

<p>For the most part, these are animals or plants. The profane
function of vegetables and even of animals is ordinarily to serve
as food; then the sacred character of the totemic animal or plant
is shown by the fact that it is forbidden to eat them. It is true
that since they are sacred things, they can enter into the composition
of certain mystical repasts, and we shall see, in fact,
that they sometimes serve as veritable sacraments; yet normally
they cannot be used for everyday consumption. Whoever
oversteps this rule, exposes himself to grave dangers. It is not
that the group always intervenes to punish this infraction
artificially; it is believed that the sacrilege produces death
automatically. A redoubtable principle is held to reside in the
totemic plant or animal, which cannot enter into the profane
organism without disorganizing it or destroying it.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> In certain
tribes at least, only the old men are free from this prohibition;<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
we shall see the reason for this later.</p>

<p>However, if this prohibition is formal in a large number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
tribes<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>&mdash;with certain exceptions which will be mentioned later&mdash;it
is incontestable that it tends to weaken as the old totemic
organization is disturbed. But the restrictions which remain
even then prove that these attenuations are not admitted without
difficulty. For example, when it is permitted to eat the plant
or animal that serves as totem, it is not possible to do so freely;
only a little bit may be taken at a time. To go beyond this
amount is a ritual fault that has grave consequences.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Elsewhere,
the prohibition remains intact for the parts that are regarded
as the most precious, that is to say, as the most sacred; for
example, the eggs or the fat.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> In still other parts, consumption
is not allowed except when the animal in question has not yet
reached full maturity.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In this case, they undoubtedly think
that its sacred character is not yet complete. So the barrier
which isolates and protects the totemic being yields but slowly
and with active resistance, which bears witness to what it must
have been at first.</p>

<p>It is true that according to Spencer and Gillen these restrictions
are not the remnants of what was once a rigorous prohibition
now losing hold, but the beginnings of an interdiction which is
only commencing to establish itself. These writers hold<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> that
at first there was a complete liberty of consumption and that
the limitations which were presently brought are relatively
recent. They think they find the proof of their theory in the two
following facts. In the first place, as we just said, there are
solemn occasions when the members of the clan or their chief
not only may, but must eat the totemic animal or plant. Moreover,
the myths relate that the great ancestors, the founders
of the clans, ate their totems regularly: now, it is said, these
stories cannot be understood except as an echo of a time when
the present prohibitions did not exist.</p>

<p>But the fact that in the course of certain solemn ceremonies
a consumption of the totem, and a moderate one at that, is
ritually required in no way implies that it was once an ordinary
article of food. Quite on the contrary, the food that one eats at
a mystical repast is essentially sacred, and consequently forbidden
to the profane. As for the myths, a somewhat summary
critical method is employed, if they are so readily given the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
value of historical documents. In general, their object is to
interpret existing rites rather than to commemorate past events;
they are an explanation of the present much more than a history.
In this case, the traditions according to which the ancestors
of the fabulous epoch ate their totem are in perfect accord with
the beliefs and rites which are always in force. The old men and
those who have attained a high religious dignity are freed from
the restrictions under which ordinary men are placed:<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> they
can eat the sacred thing because they are sacred themselves;
this rule is in no way peculiar to totemism, but it is found in all
the most diverse religions. Now the ancestral heroes were nearly
gods. It is therefore still more natural that they should eat the
sacred food;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> but that is no reason why the same privilege
should be awarded to the simple profane.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>However, it is neither certain nor even probable that the
prohibition was ever absolute. It seems to have always been
suspended in case of necessity, as, for example, when a man
is famished and has nothing else with which to nourish himself.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
A stronger reason for this is found when the totem is a form of
nourishment which a man cannot do without. Thus there are a
great many tribes where water is a totem; a strict prohibition
is manifestly impossible in this case. However, even here, the
privilege granted is submitted to certain restrictions which
greatly limit its use and which show clearly that it goes against
a recognized principle. Among the Kaitish and the Warramunga,
a man of this totem is not allowed to drink water freely; he may
not take it up himself; he may receive it only from the hands of
a third party who must belong to the phratry of which he is not
a member.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The complexity of this procedure and the embarrassment
which results from it are still another proof that access to
the sacred thing is not free. This same rule is applied in certain
central tribes every time that the totem is eaten, whether from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
necessity or any other cause. It should also be added that
when this formality is not possible, that is, when a man is alone
or with members of his own phratry only, he may, on necessity,
do without an intermediary. It is clear that the prohibition is
susceptible of various moderations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it rests upon ideas so strongly ingrained in the
mind that it frequently survives its original cause for being.
We have seen that in all probability, the different clans of a
phratry are only subdivisions of one original clan which has
been dismembered. So there was a time when all the clans,
being welded together, had the same totem; consequently,
wherever the souvenir of this common origin is not completely
effaced, each clan continues to feel itself united to the others and
to consider that their totems are not completely foreign to it.
For this reason an individual may not eat freely of the totems
held by the different clans of the phratry of which he is a member;
he may touch them only if the forbidden plant or animal is given
him by a member of the other phratry.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Another survival of the same sort is the one concerning the
maternal totem. There are strong reasons for believing that at
first, the totem was transmitted in the uterine line. Therefore,
wherever descent in the paternal line has been introduced, this
probably took place only after a long period, during which the
opposite principle was applied and the child had the totem of his
mother along with all the restrictions attached to it. Now in
certain tribes where the child inherits the paternal totem to-day,
some of the interdictions which originally protected the totem of
his mother still survive: he cannot eat it freely.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In the present
state of affairs, however, there is no longer anything corresponding
to this prohibition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>To this prohibition of eating is frequently added that of
killing the totem, or picking it, when it is a plant.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> However,
here also there are exceptions and tolerations. These are especially
in the case of necessity, when the totem is a dangerous animal,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
for example, or when the man has nothing to eat. There are even
tribes where men are forbidden to hunt the animals whose
names they bear, on their own accounts, but where they may kill
them for others.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> But the way in which this act is generally
accomplished clearly indicates that it is something illicit. One
excuses himself as though for a fault, and bears witness to the
chagrin which he suffers and the repugnance which he feels,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
while precautions are taken that the animal may suffer as little
as possible.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these fundamental interdictions, certain cases
of a prohibition of contact between a man and his totem are
cited. Thus among the Omaha, in the clan of the Elk, no one
may touch any part of the body of a male elk; in the sub-clan of
the Buffalo, no one is allowed to touch the head of this animal.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
Among the Bechuana, no man dares to clothe himself in the skin
of his totem.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But these cases are rare; and it is natural that
they should be exceptional, for normally a man must wear the
image of his totem or something which brings it to mind. The
tattooings and the totemic costumes would not be possible if all
contact were forbidden. It has also been remarked that this
prohibition has not been found in Australia, but only in those
societies where totemism has advanced far from its original
form; it is therefore probably of late origin and due perhaps to
the influence of ideas that are really not totemic at all.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now compare these various interdictions with those
whose object is the totemic emblem, contrarily to all that could
be foreseen, it appears that these latter are more numerous,
stricter, and more severely enforced than the former. The figures
of all sorts which represent the totem are surrounded with a
respect sensibly superior to that inspired by the very being
whose form these figures reproduce. The churinga, the nurtunja
and the waninga can never be handled by the women or the
uninitiated, who are even allowed to catch glimpses of it only
very exceptionally, and from a respectful distance. On the other
hand, the plant or animal whose name the clan bears may be
seen and touched by everybody. The churinga are preserved
in a sort of temple, upon whose threshold all noises from the
profane life must cease; it is the domain of sacred things. On
the contrary, the totemic animals and plants live in the profane
world and are mixed up with the common everyday life. Since
the number and importance of the interdictions which isolate
a sacred thing, and keep it apart, correspond to the degree of
sacredness with which it is invested, we arrive at the remarkable
conclusion that <i>the images of totemic beings are more sacred than
the beings themselves</i>. Also, in the ceremonies of the cult, it is
the churinga and the nurtunja which have the most important
place; the animal appears there only very exceptionally. In a
certain rite, of which we shall have occasion to speak,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> it serves
as the substance for a religious repast, but it plays no active
r&ocirc;le. The Arunta dance around the nurtunja, and assemble
before the image of their totem to adore it, but a similar demonstration
is never made before the totemic being itself. If this
latter were the primarily sacred object, it would be with it,
the sacred animal or plant, that the young initiate would communicate
when he is introduced into the religious life; but we
have seen that on the contrary, the most solemn moment of the
initiation is the one when the novice enters into the sanctuary
of the churinga. It is with them and the nurtunja that he communicates.
The representations of the totem are therefore more
actively powerful than the totem itself.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>We must now determine the place of man in the scheme of
religious things.</p>

<p>By the force of a whole group of acquired habits and of language
itself, we are inclined to consider the common man, the simple
believer, as an essentially profane being. It may well happen
that this conception is not literally true for any religion;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> in
any case, it is not applicable to totemism. Every member of
the clan is invested with a sacred character which is not materially
inferior to that which we just observed in the animal. This
personal sacredness is due to the fact that the man believes that
while he is a man in the usual sense of the word, he is also an
animal or plant of the totemic species.</p>

<p>In fact, he bears its name; this identity of name is therefore
supposed to imply an identity of nature. The first is not merely
considered as an outward sign of the second; it supposes it
logically. This is because the name, for a primitive, is not merely
a word or a combination of sounds; it is a part of the being, and
even something essential to it. A member of the Kangaroo clan
calls himself a kangaroo; he is therefore, in one sense, an animal
of this species. "The totem of any man," say Spencer and
Gillen, "is regarded as the same thing as himself; a native once
said to us when we were discussing the matter with him, 'That
one,' pointing to his photograph which we had taken, 'is the
same thing as me: so is a kangaroo' (his totem)."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> So each
individual has a double nature: two beings coexist within him,
a man and an animal.</p>

<p>In order to give a semblance of intelligibility to this duality,
so strange for us, the primitive has invented myths which, it is
true, explain nothing and only shift the difficulty, but which,
by shifting it, seem at least to lessen the logical scandal. With
slight variations of detail, all are constructed on the same plan:
their object is to establish genealogical connections between the
man and the totemic animal, making the one a relative of the
other. By this common origin, which, by the way, is represented
in various manners, they believe that they account for their
common nature. The Narrinyeri, for example, have imagined
that certain of the first men had the power of transforming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
themselves into beasts.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Other Australian societies place at the
beginning of humanity either strange animals from which the
men were descended in some unknown way,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> or mixed beings,
half-way between the two kingdoms,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> or else unformed creatures,
hardly representable, deprived of all determined organs, and
even of all definite members, and the different parts of whose
bodies were hardly outlined.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Mythical powers, sometimes
conceived under the form of animals, then intervened and made
men out of these ambiguous and innumerable beings which
Spencer and Gillen say represent "stages in the transformation
of animals and plants into human beings."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> These transformations
are represented to us under the form of violent and, as it
were, surgical operations. It is under the blows of an axe or, if
the operator is a bird, blows of the beak, that the human individual
was carved out of this shapeless mass, his members
separated from each other, his mouth opened and his nostrils
pierced.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Analogous legends are found in America, except that
owing to the more highly developed mentality of these peoples,
the representations which they employ do not contain confusions
so troublesome for the mind. Sometimes it is a legendary
personage who, by an act of his power, metamorphosed the
animal who gives its name to the clan into a man.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Sometimes
the myth attempts to explain how, by a series of nearly natural
events and a sort of spontaneous evolution, the animal transformed
himself little by little, and finally took a human form.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that there are societies (the Haida, Tlinkit, Tsimshian)
where it is no longer admitted that man was born of an
animal or plant; but the idea of an affinity between the animals
of the totemic species and the members of the clan has survived
there nevertheless, and expresses itself in myths which, though
differing from the preceding, still retain all that is essential in
them. Here is one of the fundamental themes. The ancestor
who gives his name to the clan is here represented as a human
being, but who, in the course of various wanderings, has been
led to live for a while among the fabulous animals of the very
species which gave the clan its name. As the result of this intimate
and prolonged connection, he became so like his new
companions that when he returned to men, they no longer
recognized him. He was therefore given the name of the animal
which he resembled. It is from his stay in this mythical land
that he brought back the totemic emblem, together with the
powers and virtues believed to be attached to it.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Thus in this
case, as in the others, men are believed to participate in the
nature of the animal, though this participation may be conceived
in slightly different forms.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>So man also has something sacred about him. Though diffused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
into the whole organism, this characteristic is especially apparent
in certain privileged places. There are organs and tissues that
are specially marked out: these are particularly the blood and
the hair.</p>

<p>In the first place, human blood is so holy a thing that in the
tribes of Central Australia, it frequently serves to consecrate
the most respected instruments of the cult. For example, in
certain cases, the nurtunja is regularly anointed from top to
bottom with the blood of a man.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> It is upon ground all saturated
with blood that the men of the Emu, among the Arunta, trace
their sacred images.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> We shall presently see that streams of
blood are poured upon the rocks which represent the totemic
animals and plants.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> There is no religious ceremony where blood
does not have some part to play.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> During the initiation, the
adults open their veins and sprinkle the novice with their blood;
and this blood is so sacred a thing that women may not be
present while it is flowing; the sight of it is forbidden them,
just as the sight of a churinga is.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The blood lost by a young
initiate during the very violent operations he must undergo
has very particular virtues: it is used in various ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
That which flows during the sub-incision is piously kept by the
Arunta and buried in a place upon which they put a piece of
wood warning passers-by of the sacredness of the spot; no
woman should approach it.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The religious nature of blood also
explains the equal importance, religiously, of the red ochre,
which is very frequently employed in ceremonies; they rub the
churinga with it and use it in ritual decorations.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> This is due to
the fact that because of its colour, it is regarded as something
kindred to blood. Many deposits of red ochre which are found
in the Arunta territory are even supposed to be the coagulated
blood which certain heroines of the mythical period shed on to
the soil.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Hair has similar properties. The natives of the centre wear
belts made of human hair, whose religious functions we have
already pointed out: they are also used to wrap up certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
instruments of the cult.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Does one man loan another one of his
churinga? As a sign of acknowledgment, the second makes
a present of hair to the first; these two sorts of things are therefore
thought to be of the same order and of equivalent value.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
So the operation of cutting the hair is a ritual act, accompanied
by definite ceremonies: the individual operated upon must
squat on the ground, with his face turned in the direction of the
place where the fabulous ancestors from which the clan of his
mother is believed to be descended, are thought to have camped.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
For the same reason, as soon as a man is dead, they cut his hair
off and put it away in some distant place, for neither women
nor the non-initiated have the right of seeing it: it is here, far
from profane eyes, that the belts are made.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Other organic tissues might be mentioned which have similar
properties, in varying degrees: such are the whiskers, the foreskin,
the fat of the liver, etc.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> But it is useless to multiply
examples. Those already given are enough to prove that there
is something in man which holds profane things at a distance
and which possesses a religious power; in other words, the
human organism conceals within its depths a sacred principle,
which visibly comes to the surface in certain determined cases.
This principle does not differ materially from that which causes
the religious character of the totem. In fact, we have just seen
that the different substances in which it incarnates itself especially
enter into the ritual composition of the objects of the cult
(nurtunja, totemic designs), or else are used in the anointings
whose object is to renew the virtues either of the churinga or of
the sacred rocks; they are things of the same species.</p>

<p>Sometimes the religious dignity which is inherent in each
member of the clan on this account is not equal for all. Men
possess it to a higher degree than women; in relation to them,
women are like profane beings.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Thus, every time that there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
an assembly, either of the totemic group or of the tribe, the
men have a separate camp, distinct from that of the women,
and into which these latter may not enter: they are separated
off.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> But there are also differences in the way in which men
are marked with a religious character. The young men not yet
initiated are wholly deprived of it, since they are not admitted
to the ceremonies. It is among the old men that it reaches its
greatest intensity. They are so very sacred that certain things
forbidden to ordinary people are permissible for them: they may
eat the totemic animal more freely and, as we have seen, there
are even some tribes where they are freed from all dietetic restrictions.</p>

<p>So we must be careful not to consider totemism a sort of
animal worship. The attitude of a man towards the animals or
plants whose name he bears is not at all that of a believer towards
his god, for he belongs to the sacred world himself. Their
relations are rather those of two beings who are on the same
level and of equal value. The most that can be said is that
in certain cases, at least, the animal seems to occupy a slightly
more elevated place in the hierarchy of sacred things. It is
because of this that it is sometimes called the father or the
grandfather of the men of the clan, which seems to show that
they feel themselves in a state of moral dependence in regard
to it.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But in other, and perhaps even more frequent cases, it
happens that the expressions used denote rather a sentiment
of equality. The totemic animal is called the friend or the
elder brother of its human fellows.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Finally, the bonds which
exist between them and it are much more like those which unite
the members of a single family; the animals and the men are
made of the same flesh, as the Buandik say.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> On account of this
kinship, men regard the animals of the totemic species as kindly
associates upon whose aid they think they can rely. They
call them to their aid<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and they come, to direct their blows in
the hunt and to give warning of whatever dangers there may be.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
In return for this, men treat them with regard and are never
cruel to them;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> but these attentions in no way resemble a cult.</p>

<p>Men sometimes even appear to have a mysterious sort of
property-right over their totems. The prohibition against
killing and eating them is applied only to members of the clan,
of course; it could not be extended to other persons without
making life practically impossible. If, in a tribe like the Arunta,
where there is such a host of different totems, it were forbidden
to eat, not only the animal or plant whose name one bears, but
also all the animals and all the plants which serve as totems
to other clans, the sources of food would be reduced to nothing.
Yet there are tribes where the consumption of the totemic plant
or animal is not allowed without restrictions, even to foreigners.
Among the Wakelbura, it must not take place in the presence of
men of this totem.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> In other places, their permission must be
given. For example, among the Kaitish and the Unmatjera,
whenever a man of the Emu totem happens to be in a place
occupied by a grass-seed clan, and gathers some of these seed,
before eating them he must go to the chief and say to him,
"I have gathered these seeds in your country." To this the
chief replies, "All right; you may eat them." But if the Emu
man ate them before demanding permission, it is believed that
he would fall sick and run the risk of dying.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> There are even
cases where the chief of the group must take a little of the food
and eat it himself: it is a sort of payment which must be made.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
For the same reason, the churinga gives the hunter a certain
power over the corresponding animal: by rubbing his body
with a Euro churinga, for example, a man acquires a greater
chance of catching euros.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> This is the proof that the fact of
participating in the nature of a totemic being confers a sort of
eminent right over this latter. Finally, there is one tribe in
northern Queensland, the Karingbool, where the men of the
totem are the only ones who have a right to kill the animal or,
if the totem is a tree, to peel off its bark. Their aid is indispensable
to all others who want to use the flesh of this animal or the wood
of this tree for their own personal ends.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> So they appear as
proprietors, though it is quite evidently over a special sort of
property, of which we find it hard to form an idea.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER III</b><br /><br />

<small>TOTEMIC BELIEFS&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

<i>The Cosmological System of Totemism and the Idea of Class</i></h3>


<p>We are beginning to see that totemism is a much more
complex religion than it first appeared to be. We have
already distinguished three classes of things which it recognizes
as sacred, in varying degrees: the totemic emblem, the animal
or plant whose appearance this emblem reproduces, and the
members of the clan. However, this list is not yet complete.
In fact, a religion is not merely a collection of fragmentary
beliefs in regard to special objects like those we have just been
discussing. To a greater or less extent, all known religions have
been systems of ideas which tend to embrace the universality of
things, and to give us a complete representation of the world.
If totemism is to be considered as a religion comparable to the
others, it too should offer us a conception of the universe. As
a matter of fact, it does satisfy this condition.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The fact that this aspect of totemism has generally been
neglected is due to the too narrow notion of the clan which has
been prevalent. Ordinarily it is regarded as a mere group of
human beings. Being a simple subdivision of the tribe, it seems
that like this, it is made up of nothing but men. But in reasoning
thus, we substitute our European ideas for those which
the primitive has of man and of society. For the Australian,
things themselves, everything which is in the universe, are a
part of the tribe; they are constituent elements of it and, so
to speak, regular members of it; just like men, they have
a determined place in the general scheme of organization of the
society. "The South Australian savage," says Fison, "looks
upon the universe as the Great Tribe, to one of whose divisions
he himself belongs; and all things, animate and inanimate,
which belong to his class are parts of the body corporate whereof
he himself is a part."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> As a consequence of this principle,
whenever the tribe is divided into two phratries, all known
things are distributed between them. "All nature," says
Palmer, in speaking of the Bellinger River tribe, "is also divided
into class [phratry] names.... The sun and moon and stars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
are said ... to belong to classes [phratries] just as the blacks
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The Port Mackay tribe in Queensland has two
phratries with the names Yungaroo and Wootaroo, as do the
neighbouring tribes. Now as Bridgmann says, "all things,
animate and inanimate, are divided by these tribes into two
classes, named Yungaroo and Wootaroo."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Nor does the classification
stop here. The men of each phratry are distributed
among a certain number of clans; likewise, the things attributed
to each phratry are in their turn distributed among the clans
of which the phratry is composed. A certain tree, for example,
will be assigned to the Kangaroo clan, and to it alone; then,
just like the human members of the clan, it will have the Kangaroo
as totem; another will belong to the Snake clan; clouds will
be placed under one totem, the sun under another, etc. All
known things will thus be arranged in a sort of tableau or systematic
classification embracing the whole of nature.</p>

<p>We have given a certain number of these classifications elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
at present we shall confine ourselves to repeating a few
of these as examples. One of the best known of these is the one
found in the Mount Gambier tribe. This tribe includes two
phratries, named respectively the Kumite and the Kroki; each
of these, in its turn, is subdivided into five clans. Now "everything
in nature belongs to one or another of these ten clans";<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Fison and Howitt say that they are all "included" within it.
In fact, they are classified under these ten totems just like
species in their respective classes. This is well shown by the
following table based on information gathered by Curr and by
Fison and Howitt.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>The list of things attached to each clan is quite incomplete;
Curr himself warns us that he has limited himself to enumerating
some of them. But through the work of Mathews and of Howitt<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
we have more extended information to-day on the classification
adopted by the Wotjobaluk tribe, which enables us to understand
better how a system of this kind is able to include the whole
universe, as known to the natives. The Wotjobaluk also are
divided into two phratries called Gurogity and Gumaty (Krokitch
and Gamutch according to Howitt<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>); not to prolong this
enumeration, we shall content ourselves with indicating, after
Mathews, the things classed in some of the clans of the Gurogity
phratry.</p>

<p>In the clan of the Yam are classified the plain-turkey, the
native cat, the <i>mopoke</i>, the <i>dyim-dyim</i> owl, the <i>mallee</i> hen, the
rosella parrot, the peewee.</p>

<p>In the Mussel<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> clan are the grey emu, the porcupine, the curlew,
the white cockatoo, the wood-duck, the <i>mallee</i> lizard, the
stinking turtle, the flying squirrel, the ring-tail opossum, the
bronze-wing pigeon, the <i>wijuggla</i>.</p>

<p>In the Sun clan are the bandicoot, the moon, the kangaroo-rat,
the black and white magpies, the opossum, the <i>ng&#365;rt</i> hawk, the
gum-tree grub, the wattle-tree grub, the planet Venus.</p>

<p>In the clan of the Warm Wind<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> are the grey-headed eagle-hawk,
the carpet snake, the smoker parrot, the shell parrot, the
<i>murrakan</i> hawk, the <i>dikkomur</i> snake, the ring-neck parrot, the
<i>mirudai</i> snake, the shingle-back lizard.</p>

<p>If we remember that there are many other clans (Howitt
names twelve and Mathews fourteen and adds that his list is
incomplete<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>), we will understand how all the things in which the
native takes an interest find a natural place in these classifications.</p>

<p>Similar arrangements have been observed in the most diverse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>parts of the Australian continent; in South Australia, in Victoria,
and in New South Wales (among the Euahlayi<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>); very
clear traces of it are found in the central tribes.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In Queensland,
where the clans seem to have disappeared and where the matrimonial
classes are the only subdivisions of the phratry, things
are divided up among these classes. Thus, the Wakelbura are
divided into two phratries, Mallera and Wutaru; the classes
of the first are called Kurgilla and Banbe, those of the second,
Wungo and Obu. Now to the Banbe belong the opossum, the
kangaroo, the dog, honey of little bees, etc.; to the Wungo are
attributed the emu, the bandicoot, the black duck, the black
snake, the brown snake; to the Obu, the carpet snake, the
honey of stinging bees, etc.; to the Kurgilla, the porcupine, the
turkey of the plains, water, rain, fire, thunder, etc.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>This same organization is found among the Indians of North
America. The Zu&ntilde;i have a system of classification which, in its
essential lines, is in all points comparable to the one we have
just described. That of the Omaha rests on the same principles
as that of the Wotjobaluk.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> An echo of these same ideas survives
even into the more advanced societies. Among the Haida,
all the gods and mythical beings who are placed in charge of
the different phenomena of nature are classified in one or the
other of the two phratries which make up the tribe just like men;
some are Eagles, the others, Crows.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Now the gods of things are
only another aspect of the things which they govern.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> This
mythological classification is therefore merely another form of
the preceding one. So we may rest assured that this way of
conceiving the world is independent of all ethnic or geographic
particularities; and at the same time it is clearly seen to be
closely united to the whole system of totemic beliefs.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>In the paper to which we have already made allusion several
times, we have shown what light these facts throw upon the
way in which the idea of kind or class was formed in humanity.
In fact, these systematic classifications are the first we meet with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
in history, and we have just seen that they are modelled upon
the social organization, or rather that they have taken the forms
of society as their framework. It is the phratries which have
served as classes, and the clans as species. It is because men
were organized that they have been able to organize things, for
in classifying these latter, they limited themselves to giving them
places in the groups they formed themselves. And if these
different classes of things are not merely put next to each other,
but are arranged according to a unified plan, it is because the
social groups with which they commingle themselves are unified
and, through their union, form an organic whole, the tribe.
The unity of these first logical systems merely reproduces the
unity of the society. Thus we have an occasion for verifying the
proposition which we laid down at the commencement of this
work, and for assuring ourselves that the fundamental notions of
the intellect, the essential categories of thought, may be the
product of social factors. The above-mentioned facts show
clearly that this is the case with the very notion of category itself.</p>

<p>However, it is not our intention to deny that the individual
intellect has of itself the power of perceiving resemblances
between the different objects of which it is conscious. Quite on
the contrary, it is clear that even the most primitive and simple
classifications presuppose this faculty. The Australian does not
place things in the same clan or in different clans at random.
For him as for us, similar images attract one another, while
opposed ones repel one another, and it is on the basis of these
feelings of affinity or of repulsion that he classifies the corresponding
things in one place or another.</p>

<p>There are also cases where we are able to perceive the reasons
which inspired this. The two phratries were very probably the
original and fundamental bases for these classifications, which
were consequently bifurcate at first. Now, when a classification
is reduced to two classes, these are almost necessarily conceived
as antitheses; they are used primarily as a means of clearly
separating things between which there is a very marked contrast.
Some are set at the right, the others at the left. As a matter
of fact this is the character of the Australian classifications. If
the white cockatoo is in one phratry, the black one is in the
other; if the sun is on one side, the moon and the stars of night
are on the opposite side.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Very frequently the beings which
serve as the totems of the two phratries have contrary colours.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
These oppositions are even met with outside of Australia. Where
one of the phratries is disposed to peace, the other is disposed to
war;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> if one has water as its totem, the other has earth.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> This
is undoubtedly the explanation of why the two phratries have
frequently been thought of as naturally antagonistic to one
another. They say that there is a sort of rivalry or even a constitutional
hostility between them.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> This opposition of things
has extended itself to persons; the logical contrast has begotten
a sort of social conflict.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>It is also to be observed that within each phratry, those things
have been placed in a single clan which seem to have the greatest
affinity with that serving as totem. For example, the moon has
been placed with the black cockatoo, but the sun, together with
the atmosphere and the wind, with the white cockatoo. Or again,
to a totemic animal has been united all that serves him as food,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
as well as the animals with which he has the closest connection.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Of course, we cannot always understand the obscure psychology
which has caused many of these connections and distinctions,
but the preceding examples are enough to show that a certain
intuition of the resemblances and differences presented by things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
has played an important part in the genesis of these classifications.</p>

<p>But the feeling of resemblances is one thing and the idea of
class is another. The class is the external framework of which
objects perceived to be similar form, in part, the contents. Now
the contents cannot furnish the frame into which they fit. They
are made up of <i>vague and fluctuating</i> images, due to the super-imposition
and partial fusion of a <i>determined number of individual
images</i>, which are found to have common elements; the framework,
on the contrary, is a <i>definite form</i>, with fixed outlines, but
which may be applied to an <i>undetermined number of things</i>, perceived
or not, actual or possible. In fact, every class has possibilities
of extension which go far beyond the circle of objects
which we know, either from direct experience or from resemblance.
This is why every school of thinkers has refused, and not with
good reason, to identify the idea of class with that of a generic
image. The generic image is only the indistinctly-bounded
residual representation left in us by similar representations, when
they are present in consciousness simultaneously; the class is
a logical symbol by means of which we think distinctly of these
similarities and of other analogous ones. Moreover, the best
proof of the distance separating these two notions is that an
animal is able to form generic images though ignorant of the
art of thinking in classes and species.</p>

<p>The idea of class is an instrument of thought which has obviously
been constructed by men. But in constructing it, we
have at least had need of a model; for how could this idea ever
have been born, if there had been nothing either in us or around
us which was capable of suggesting it to us? To reply that it
was given to us <i>a priori</i> is not to reply at all; this lazy man's
solution is, as has been said, the death of analysis. But it is hard
to see where we could have found this indispensable model except
in the spectacle of the collective life. In fact, a class is not an
ideal, but a clearly defined group of things between which internal
relationships exist, similar to those of kindred. Now the
only groups of this sort known from experience are those formed
by men in associating themselves. Material things may be able
to form collections of units, or heaps, or mechanical assemblages
with no internal unity, but not groups in the sense we have
given the word. A heap of sand or a pile of rock is in no way
comparable to that variety of definite and organized society
which forms a class. In all probability, we would never have
thought of uniting the beings of the universe into homogeneous
groups, called classes, if we had not had the example of human
societies before our eyes, if we had not even commenced by making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
things themselves members of men's society, and also if human
groups and logical groups had not been confused at first.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>It is also to be borne in mind that a classification is a system
whose parts are arranged according to a hierarchy. There are
dominating members and others which are subordinate to the
first; species and their distinctive properties depend upon
classes and the attributes which characterize them; again, the
different species of a single class are conceived as all placed on
the same level in regard to each other. Does someone prefer
to regard them from the point of view of the understanding?
Then he represents things to himself in an inverse order: he
puts at the top the species that are the most particularized and
the richest in reality, while the types that are most general and
the poorest in qualities are at the bottom. Nevertheless, all are
represented in a hierarchic form. And we must be careful not
to believe that the expression has only a metaphorical sense here:
there are really relations of subordination and co-ordination, the
establishment of which is the object of all classification, and men
would never have thought of arranging their knowledge in this
way if they had not known beforehand what a hierarchy was.
But neither the spectacle of physical nature nor the mechanism
of mental associations could furnish them with this knowledge.
The hierarchy is exclusively a social affair. It is only in society
that there are superiors, inferiors and equals. Consequently,
even if the facts were not enough to prove it, the mere analysis
of these ideas would reveal their origin. We have taken them
from society, and projected them into our conceptions of the
world. It is society that has furnished the outlines which logical
thought has filled in.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>But these primitive classifications have a no less direct interest
for the origins of religious thought.</p>

<p>They imply that all the things thus classed in a single clan or
a single phratry are closely related both to each other and to the
thing serving as the totem of this clan or phratry. When an Australian
of the Port Mackay tribe says that the sun, snakes, etc., are of
the Yungaroo phratry, he does not mean merely to apply a common,
but none the less a purely conventional, nomenclature to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
these different things; the word has an objective signification for
him. He believes that "alligators really <i>are</i> Yungaroo and that
kangaroos are Wootaroo. The sun <i>is</i> Yungaroo, the moon Wootaroo,
and so on for the constellations, trees, plants, etc."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> An
internal bond attaches them to the group in which they are placed;
they are regular members of it. It is said that they belong to the
group,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> just exactly as the individual men make a part of it;
consequently, the same sort of a relation unites them to these
latter. Men regard the things in their clan as their relatives or
associates; they call them their friends and think that they are
made out of the same flesh as themselves.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Therefore, between
the two there are elective affinities and quite special relations of
agreement. Things and people have a common name, and in
a certain way they naturally understand each other and harmonize
with one another. For example, when a Wakelbura of
the Mallera phratry is buried, the scaffold upon which the body
is exposed "must be made of the wood of some tree belonging
to the Mallera phratry."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The same is true for the branches that
cover the corpse. If the deceased is of the Banbe class, a Banbe
tree must be used. In this same tribe, a magician can use in his
art only those things which belong to his own phratry;<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> since
the others are strangers to him, he does not know how to make
them obey him. Thus a bond of mystic sympathy unites each
individual to those beings, whether living or not, which are associated
with him; the result of this is a belief in the possibility
of deducing what he will do or what he has done from what they
are doing. Among these same Wakelbura, when a man dreams
that he has killed an animal belonging to a certain social division,
he expects to meet a man of this same division the next day.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
Inversely, the things attributed to a clan or phratry cannot be
used against the members of this clan or phratry. Among the
Wotjobaluk, each phratry has its own special trees. Now in
hunting an animal of the Gurogity phratry, only arms whose
wood is taken from trees of the other phratry may be used, and
<i>vice versa</i>; otherwise the hunter is sure to miss his aim.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The
native is convinced that the arrow would turn of itself and refuse,
so to speak, to hit a kindred and friendly animal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the men of the clan and the things which are classified
in it form by their union a solid system, all of whose parts are
united and vibrate sympathetically. This organization, which at
first may have appeared to us as purely logical, is at the same
time moral. A single principle animates it and makes its unity:
this is the totem. Just as a man who belongs to the Crow clan
has within him something of this animal, so the rain, since it is
of the same clan and belongs to the same totem, is also necessarily
considered as being "the same thing as a crow"; for the same
reason, the moon is a black cockatoo, the sun a white cockatoo,
every black-nut tree a pelican, etc. All the beings arranged in
a single clan, whether men, animals, plants or inanimate objects,
are merely forms of the totemic being. This is the meaning of the
formula which we have just cited and this is what makes the two
really of the same species: all are really of the same flesh in the
sense that all partake of the nature of the totemic animal. Also,
the qualifiers given them are those given to the totem.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The
Wotjobaluk give the name <i>Mir</i> both to the totem and to the
things classed with it.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> It is true that among the Arunta, where
visible traces of classification still exist, as we shall see, different
words designate the totem and the other beings placed with it;
however, the name given to these latter bears witness to the close
relations which unite them to the totemic animal. It is said that
they are its <i>intimates</i>, its <i>associates</i>, its <i>friends</i>; it is believed that
they are inseparable from it.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> So there is a feeling that these are
very closely related things.</p>

<p>But we also know that the totemic animal is a sacred being.
All the things that are classified in the clan of which it is the
emblem have this same character, because in one sense, they are
animals of the same species, just as the man is. They, too, are
sacred, and the classifications which locate them in relation to
the other things of the universe, by that very act give them a
place in the religious world. For this reason, the animals or
plants among these may not be eaten freely by the human
members of the clan. Thus in the Mount Gambier tribe, the men
whose totem is a certain non-poisonous snake must not merely
refrain from eating the flesh of this snake; that of seals, eels, etc.,
is also forbidden to them.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> If, driven by necessity, they do eat
some of it, they must at least attenuate the sacrilege by expiatory
rites, just as if they had eaten the totem itself.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Euahlayi, where it is permitted to use the totem, but not to
abuse it, the same rule is applied to the other members of the
clan.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Among the Arunta, the interdictions protecting the
totemic animal extend over the associated animals;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and in any
case, particular attention must be given to these latter.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The
sentiments inspired by the two are identical.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>But the fact that the things thus attached to the totem are
not of a different nature from it, and consequently have a religious
character, is best proved by the fact that on certain
occasions they fulfil the same functions. They are accessory or
secondary totems, or, according to an expression now consecrated
by usage, they are sub-totems.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>  It is constantly happening
in the clans that under the influence of various sympathies, particular
affinities are forming, smaller groups and more limited
associations arise, which tend to lead a relatively autonomous
life and to form a new subdivision like a sub-clan within the
larger one. In order to distinguish and individualize itself, this
sub-clan needs a special totem or, consequently, a sub-totem.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
Now the totems of these secondary groups are chosen from
among the things classified under the principal totem. So they
are always almost totems and the slightest circumstance is
enough to make them actually so. There is a latent totemic
nature in them, which shows itself as soon as conditions permit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
it or demand it. It thus happens that a single individual has two
totems, a principal totem common to the whole clan and a sub-totem
which is special to the sub-clan of which he is a member.
This is something analogous to the <i>nomen</i> and <i>cognomen</i> of the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes we see a sub-clan emancipate itself completely and
become an autonomous group and an independent clan; then,
the sub-totem, on its side, becomes a regular totem. One tribe
where this process of segmentation has been pushed to the limit,
so to speak, is the Arunta. The information contained in the
first book of Spencer and Gillen showed that there were some
sixty totems among the Arunta;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> but the recent researches of
Strehlow have shown the number to be much larger. He counted
no less than 442.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Spencer and Gillen did not exaggerate at all
when they said, "In fact, there is scarcely an object, animate
or inanimate, to be found in the country occupied by the natives
which does not give its name to some totemic group."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Now
this multitude of totems, whose number is prodigious when compared
to the population, is due to the fact that under special
circumstances, the original clans have divided and sub-divided
infinitely; consequently nearly all the sub-totems have passed
to the stage of totems.</p>

<p>This has been definitely proved by the observations of Strehlow.
Spencer and Gillen cited only certain isolated cases of
associated totems.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Strehlow has shown that this is in reality
an absolutely general organization. He has been able to draw
up a table where nearly all the totems of the Arunta are classified
according to this principle: all are attached, either as associates
or as auxiliaries, to some sixty principal totems.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The first
are believed to be in the service of the second.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> This state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
dependence is very probably the echo of a time when the "allies"
of to-day were only sub-totems, and consequently when the tribe
contained only a small number of clans subdivided into sub-clans.
Numerous survivals confirm this hypothesis. It frequently
happens that two groups thus associated have the same
totemic emblem: now this unity of emblem is explicable only
if the two groups were at first only one.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The relation of the
two clans is also shown by the part and the interest that each
one takes in the rites of the other. The two cults are still only
imperfectly separated; this is very probably because they were
at first completely intermingled.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Tradition explains the bonds
which unite them by imagining that formerly the two clans
occupied neighbouring places.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In other cases, the myth says
expressly that one of them was derived from the other. It is
related that at first the associated animal belonged to the species
still serving as principal totem; it differentiated itself at a later
period. Thus the chantunga birds, which are associated with
the witchetly grub to-day, were witchetly grubs in fabulous
times, who later transformed themselves into birds. Two
species which are now attached to the honey-ant were formerly
honey-ants, etc.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> This transformation of a sub-totem into a
totem goes on by imperceptible degrees, so that in certain cases
the situation is undecided, and it is hard to say whether one is
dealing with a principal totem or a secondary one.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> As Howitt
says in regard to the Wotjobaluk, there are sub-totems which are
totems in formation.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Thus the different things classified in a
clan constitute, as it were, so many nuclei around which new
totemic cults are able to form. This is the best proof of the
religious sentiments which they inspire. If they did not have a
sacred character, they could not be promoted so easily to the
same dignity as the things which are sacred before all others, the
regular totems.</p>

<p>So the field of religious things extends well beyond the limits
within which it seemed to be confined at first. It embraces not
only the totemic animals and the human members of the clan; but
since no known thing exists that is not classified in a clan and
under a totem, there is likewise nothing which does not receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to some degree something of a religious character. When, in the
religions which later come into being, the gods properly so-called
appear, each of them will be set over a special category of
natural phenomena, this one over the sea, that one over the air,
another over the harvest or over fruits, etc., and each of these
provinces of nature will be believed to draw what life there is in it
from the god upon whom it depends. This division of nature
among the different divinities constitutes the conception which
these religions give us of the universe. Now so long as humanity
has not passed the phase of totemism, the different totems of
the tribe fulfil exactly the same functions that will later fall upon
the divine personalities. In the Mount Gambier tribe, which we
have taken as our principal example, there are ten clans; consequently
the entire world is divided into ten classes, or rather
into ten families, each of which has a special totem as its basis.
It is from this basis that the things classed in the clan get all
their reality, for they are thought of as variant forms of the
totemic being; to return to our example, the rain, thunder,
lightning, clouds, hail and winter are regarded as different sorts
of crows. When brought together, these ten families of things
make up a complete and systematic representation of the world;
and this representation is religious, for religious notions furnish
its basis. Far from being limited to one or two categories of
beings, the domain of totemic religion extends to the final limits
of the known universe. Just like the Greek religion, it puts the
divine everywhere; the celebrated formula
&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#955;&#942;&#961;&#951; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957;
(everything is full of the gods), might equally well serve it as
motto.</p>

<p>However, if totemism is to be represented thus, the notion of
it which has long been held must be modified on one essential
point. Until the discoveries of recent years, it was made to
consist entirely in the cult of one particular totem, and it was
defined as the religion of the clan. From this point of view,
each tribe seemed to have as many totemic religions, each independent
of the others, as it had different clans. This conception
was also in harmony with the idea currently held of the clan; in
fact, this was regarded as an autonomous society,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> more or less
closed to other similar societies, or having only external and
superficial relations with these latter. But the reality is more
complex. Undoubtedly, the cult of each totem has its home
in the corresponding clan; it is there, and only there, that it is
celebrated; it is members of the clan who have charge of it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
it is through them that it is transmitted from one generation
to another, along with the beliefs which are its basis. But it is
also true that the different totemic cults thus practised within
a single tribe do not have a parallel development, though remaining
ignorant of each other, as if each of them constituted
a complete and self-sufficing religion. On the contrary, they
mutually imply each other; they are only the parts of a single
whole, the elements of a single religion. The men of one clan
never regard the beliefs of neighbouring clans with that indifference,
scepticism or hostility which one religion ordinarily
inspires for another which is foreign to it; they partake of these
beliefs themselves. The Crow people are also convinced that
the Snake people have a mythical serpent as ancestor, and that
they owe special virtues and marvellous powers to this origin.
And have we not seen that at least in certain conditions, a man
may eat a totem that is not his own only after he has observed
certain ritual formalities? Especially, he must demand the
permission of the men of this totem, if any are present. So for
him also, this food is not entirely profane; he also admits that
there are intimate affinities between the members of a clan of
which he is not a member and the animal whose name they bear.
Also, this community of belief is sometimes shown in the cult.
If in theory the rites concerning a totem can be performed only
by the men of this totem, nevertheless representatives of different
clans frequently assist at them. It sometimes happens that
their part is not simply that of spectators; it is true that they
do not officiate, but they decorate the officiants and prepare
the service. They themselves have an interest in its being
celebrated; therefore, in certain tribes, it is they who invite the
qualified clan to proceed with the ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> There is even a
whole cycle of rites which must take place in the presence of the
assembled tribe: these are the totemic ceremonies of initiation.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the totemic organization, such as we have just
described it, must obviously be the result of some sort of an
indistinct understanding between all the members of the tribe.
It is impossible that each clan should have made its beliefs in
an absolutely independent manner; it is absolutely necessary
that the cults of the different totems should be in some way
adjusted to each other, since they complete one another exactly.
In fact, we have seen that normally a single totem is not repeated
twice in the same tribe, and that the whole universe is divided
up among the totems thus constituted in such a way that the
same object is not found in two different clans. So methodical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
a division could never have been made without an agreement,
tacit or planned, in which the whole tribe participated. So the
group of beliefs which thus arise are partially (but only partially)
a tribal affair.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>To sum up, then, in order to form an adequate idea of totemism,
we must not confine ourselves within the limits of the clan, but
must consider the tribe as a whole. It is true that the particular
cult of each clan enjoys a very great autonomy; we can now see
that it is within the clan that the active ferment of the religious life
takes place. But it is also true that these cults fit into each other
and the totemic religion is a complex system formed by their union,
just as Greek polytheism was made by the union of all the particular
cults addressed to the different divinities. We have just shown
that, thus understood, totemism also has it cosmology.</p>

<small>TOTEMIC BELIEFS&mdash;<i>end</i></small><br /><br />

<i>The Individual Totem and the Sexual Totem</i></h3>


<p>Up to the present, we have studied totemism only as a
public institution: the only totems of which we have
spoken are common to a clan, a phratry or, in a sense, to a tribe;<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
an individual has a part in them only as a member of a group.
But we know that there is no religion which does not have an
individual aspect. This general observation is applicable to
totemism. In addition to the impersonal and collective totems
which hold the first place, there are others which are peculiar
to each individual, which express his personality, and whose cult
he celebrates in private.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>In certain Australian tribes, and in the majority of the Indian
tribes of North America,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> each individual personally sustains
relations with some determined object, which are comparable
to those which each clan sustains with its totem. This is sometimes
an inanimate being or an artificial object; but it is generally
an animal. In certain cases, a special part of the organism, such
as the head, the feet or the liver, fulfils this office.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The name of the thing also serves as the name of the individual.
It is his personal name, his forename, which is added to that of
the collective totem, as the <i>praenomen</i> of the Romans was to the
<i>nomen gentilicium</i>. It is true that this fact is not reported except
in a certain number of societies,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> but it is probably general. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
fact, we shall presently show that there is an identity of nature
between the individual and the thing; now an identity of nature
implies one of name. Being given in the course of especially
important religious ceremonies, this forename has a sacred
character. It is not pronounced in the ordinary circumstances
of profane life. It even happens that the word designating this
object in the ordinary language must be modified to a greater
or less extent if it is to serve in this particular case.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> This is
because the terms of the usual language are excluded from the
religious life.</p>

<p>In certain American tribes, at least, this name is reinforced
by an emblem belonging to each individual and representing,
under various forms, the thing designated by the name. For
example, each Mandan wears the skin of the animal of which he
is the namesake.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> If it is a bird, he decorates himself with its
feathers.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> The Hurons and Algonquins tattoo their bodies with
its image.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It is represented on their arms.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Among the north-western
tribes, the individual emblem, just like the collective
emblem of the clan, is carved or engraved on the utensils, houses,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
etc.; it serves as a mark of ownership.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Frequently the two
coats-of-arms are combined together, which partially explains the
great diversity of aspects presented by the totemic escutcheons
among these peoples.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Between the individual and his animal namesake there exist
the very closest bonds. The man participates in the nature of
the animal; he has its good qualities as well as its faults. For
example, a man having the eagle as his coat-of-arms is believed
to possess the gift of seeing into the future; if he is named after
a bear, they say that he is apt to be wounded in combat, for the
bear is heavy and slow and easily caught;<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> if the animal is
despised, the man is the object of the same sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The
relationship of the two is even so close that it is believed that
in certain circumstances, especially in case of danger, the man
can take the form of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Inversely, the animal is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
regarded as a double of the man, as his <i>alter ego</i>.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The association
of the two is so close that their destinies are frequently thought
to be bound up together: nothing can happen to one without the
other's feeling a reaction.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> If the animal dies, the life of the man
is menaced. Thus it comes to be a very general rule that one
should not kill the animal, nor eat its flesh. This interdiction,
which, when concerning the totem of the clan, allows of all sorts
of attenuations and modifications, is now much more formal
and absolute.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>On its side, the animal protects the man and serves him as
a sort of patron. It informs him of possible dangers and of the
way of escaping them;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> they say that it is his friend.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Since it
frequently happens to possess marvellous powers, it communicates
them to its human associate, who believes in them, even under
the proof of bullets, arrows, and blows of every sort.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> This
confidence of an individual in the efficacy of his protector is so
great that he braves the greatest dangers and accomplishes the
most disconcerting feats with an intrepid serenity: faith gives
him the necessary courage and strength.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> However, the relations
of a man with his patron are not purely and simply those of
dependence. He, on his side, is able to act upon the animal.
He gives it orders; he has influence over it. A Kurnai having
the shark as ally and friend believes that he can disperse the
sharks who menace a boat, by means of a charm.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> In other cases,
the relations thus contracted are believed to confer upon the man
a special aptitude for hunting the animal with success.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The very nature of these relations seems clearly to imply
that the being to which each individual is thus associated is
only an individual itself, and not a species. A man does not
have a species as his <i>alter ego</i>. In fact, there are cases where it
is certainly a certain determined tree, rock or stone that fulfils
this function.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> It must be thus every time that it is an animal,
and that the existences of the animal and the man are believed
to be connected. A man could not be united so closely to a
whole species, for there is not a day nor, so to speak, an instant
when the species does not lose some one of its members. Yet
the primitive has a certain incapacity for thinking of the individual
apart from the species; the bonds uniting him to the
one readily extend to the other; he confounds the two in the
same sentiment. Thus the entire species becomes sacred for
him.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>This protector is naturally given different names in different
societies: <i>nagual</i> among the Indians of Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> <i>manitou</i> among
the Algonquins and <i>okki</i> among the Hurons,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> <i>snam</i> among certain
Salish,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> <i>sulia</i> among others,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> <i>budjan</i> among the Yuin,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> <i>yunbeai</i>
among the Euahlayi,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> etc. Owing to the importance of these
beliefs and practices among the Indians of North America, some
have proposed creating a word <i>nagualism</i> or <i>manitouism</i> to
designate them.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> But in giving them a special and distinctive
name, we run the risk of misunderstanding their relations with
the rest of totemism. In fact, the same principle is applied in
the one case to the clan and in the other to the individual. In
both cases we find the same belief that there are vital connections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
between the things and the men, and that the former are endowed
with special powers, of which their human allies may also enjoy
the advantage. We also find the same custom of giving the man
the name of the thing with which he is associated and of adding
an emblem to this name. The totem is the patron of the clan, just
as the patron of the individual is his personal totem. So it is
important that our terminology should make the relationship
of the two systems apparent; that is why we, with Frazer,
shall give the name <i>individual totemism</i> to the cult rendered by
each individual to his patron. A further justification of this
expression is found in the fact that in certain cases the primitive
himself uses the same word to designate the totem of the clan
and the animal protector of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> If Tylor and Powell
have rejected this term and demanded different ones for these
two sorts of religious institutions, it is because the collective totem
is, in their opinion, only a name or label, having no religious
character.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> But we, on the contrary, know that it is a sacred
thing, and even more so than the protecting animal. Moreover,
the continuation of our study will show how these two varieties
of totemism are inseparable from each other.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>Yet, howsoever close the kinship between these two institutions
may be, there are important differences between them. While
the clan believes that it is the offspring of the animal or plant
serving it as totem, the individual does not believe that he has
any relationship of descent with his personal totem. It is a
friend, an associate, a protector; but it is not a relative. He
takes advantage of the virtues it is believed to possess; but he
is not of the same blood. In the second place, the members of
a clan allow neighbouring clans to eat of the animal whose
name they bear collectively, under the simple condition that
the necessary formalities shall be observed. But, on the contrary,
the individual respects the species to which his personal totem
belongs and also protects it against strangers, at least in those
parts where the destiny of the man is held to be bound up with
that of the animal.</p>

<p>But the chief difference between these two sorts of totems
is in the manner in which they are acquired.</p>

<p>The collective totem is a part of the civil status of each individual:
it is generally hereditary; in any case, it is birth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which designates it, and the wish of men counts for nothing.
Sometimes the child has the totem of his mother (Kamilaroi,
Dieri, Urabunna, etc.); sometimes that of his father (Narrinyeri,
Warramunga, etc.); sometimes the one predominating in the
locality where his mother conceived (Arunta, Loritja). But, on
the contrary, the individual totem is acquired by a deliberate
act:<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> a whole series of ritual operations are necessary to determine
it. The method generally employed by the Indians of
North America is as follows. About the time of puberty, as the
time for initiation approaches, the young man withdraws into
a distant place, for example, into a forest. There, during a
period varying from a few days to several years, he submits
himself to all sorts of exhausting and unnatural exercises. He
fasts, mortifies himself and inflicts various mutilations upon
himself. Now he wanders about, uttering violent cries and
veritable howls; now he lies extended, motionless and lamenting,
upon the ground. Sometimes he dances, prays and invokes his
ordinary divinities. At last, he thus gets himself into an extreme
state of super-excitation, verging on delirium. When he has
reached this paroxysm, his representations readily take on the
character of hallucinations. "When," says Heckewelder, "a
boy is on the eve of being initiated, he is submitted to an alternating
r&eacute;gime of fasts and medical treatment; he abstains
from all food and takes the most powerful and repugnant drugs:
at times, he drinks intoxicating concoctions until his mind
really wanders. Then he has, or thinks he has, visions and extraordinary
dreams to which he was of course predisposed by all
this training. He imagines himself flying through the air, advancing
under the ground, jumping from one mountain-top to
another across the valleys, and fighting and conquering giants
and monsters."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> If in these circumstances he sees, or, as amounts
to the same thing, he thinks he sees, while dreaming or while
awake, an animal appearing to him in an attitude seeming to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
show friendly intentions, then he imagines that he has discovered
the patron he awaited.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Yet this procedure is rarely employed in Australia.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> On this
continent, the personal totem seems to be imposed by a third
party, either at birth<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> or at the moment of initiation.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Generally
it is a relative who takes this part, or else a personage invested
with special powers, such as an old man or a magician. Sometimes
divination is used for this purpose. For example, on Charlotte
Bay, Cape Bedford or the Proserpine River, the grandmother or
some other old woman takes a little piece of umbilical cord to
which the placenta is still attached and whirls it about quite
violently. Meanwhile the other old women propose different
names. That one is adopted which happens to be pronounced
just at the moment when the cord breaks.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Among the Yarrai-kanna
of Cape York, after a tooth has been knocked out of the
young initiate, they give him a little water to rinse his mouth
and ask him to spit in a bucket full of water. The old men carefully
examine the clot formed by the blood and saliva thus spit
out, and the natural object whose shape it resembles becomes
the personal totem of the young man.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> In other cases, the totem
is transmitted from one individual to another, for example from
father to son, or uncle to nephew.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> This method is also used in
America. In a case reported by Hill Tout, the operator was
a shaman,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> who wished to transmit his totem to his nephew.
"The uncle took the symbol of his <i>snam</i> (his personal totem),
which in this case was a dried bird's skin, and bade his nephew
breathe upon it. He then blew upon it also himself, uttered some
mystic words and the dried skin seemed to Paul (the nephew) to
become a living bird, which flew about them a moment or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and then finally disappeared. Paul was then instructed by his
uncle to procure that day a bird's skin of the same kind as his
uncle's and wear it on his person. This he did, and that night
he had a dream, in which the <i>snam</i> appeared to him in the shape
of a human being, disclosed to him its mystic name by which it
might be summoned, and promised him protection."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Not only is the individual totem acquired and not given, but
ordinarily the acquisition of one is not obligatory. In the first
place, there are a multitude of tribes in Australia where the custom
seems to be absolutely unknown.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Also, even where it does
exist, it is frequently optional. Thus among the Euahlayi,
while all the magicians have individual totems from which they
get their powers, there are a great number of laymen who have
none at all. It is a favour given by the magician, but which he
reserves for his friends, his favourites and those who aspire to
becoming his colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Likewise, among certain Salish, persons
desiring to excel especially either in fighting or in hunting, or
aspirants to the position of shaman, are the only ones who
provide themselves with protectors of this sort.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> So among
certain peoples, at least, the individual totem seems to be considered
an advantage and convenient thing rather than a necessity.
It is a good thing to have, but a man can do without one. Inversely,
a man need not limit himself to a single totem; if he
wishes to be more fully protected, nothing hinders his seeking
and acquiring several,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and if the one he has fulfils its part badly,
he can change it.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>But while it is more optional and free, individual totemism
contains within it a force of resistance never attained by the
totemism of the clan. One of the chief informers of Hill Tout
was a baptized Salish; however, though he had sincerely
abandoned the faith of his fathers, and though he had become
a model catechist, still his faith in the efficacy of the personal
totems remained unshaken.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Similarly, though no visible traces
of collective totemism remain in civilized countries, the idea
that there is a connection between each individual and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
animal, plant or other object, is at the bottom of many customs
still observable in many European countries.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Between collective totemism and individual totemism there is
an intermediate form partaking of the characteristics of each:
this is sexual totemism. It is found only in Australia and in a
small number of tribes. It is mentioned especially in Victoria
and New South Wales.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Mathews, it is true, claims to have
observed it in all the parts of Australia that he has visited, but
he gives no precise facts to support this affirmation.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Among these different peoples, all the men of the tribe on the
one hand, and all the women on the other, to whatever special
clan they may belong, form, as it were, two distinct and even
antagonistic societies. Now each of these two sexual corporations
believes that it is united by mystical bonds to a determined
animal. Among the Kurnai, all the men think they are brothers,
as it were, of the emu-wren (Yeer&#365;ng), all the women, that they
are as sisters of the linnet (Djeetg&#365;n); all the men are Yeer&#365;ng
and all the women are Djeetg&#365;n. Among the Wotjobaluk and the
Wurunjerri, it is the bat and the <i>nightjar</i> (a species of screech-owl)
respectively who take this r&ocirc;le. In other tribes, the woodpecker
is substituted for the <i>nightjar</i>. Each sex regards the animal to
which it is thus related as a sort of protector which must be treated
with the greatest regard; it is also forbidden to kill and eat it.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Thus this protecting animal plays the same part in relation
to the sexual society that the totem of the clan plays to this
latter group. So the expression sexual totemism, which we
borrow from Frazer,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> is justified. This new sort of totem
resembles that of the clan particularly in that it, too, is
collective; it belongs to all the people of one sex indiscriminately.
It also resembles this form in that it implies a relationship of
descent and consanguinity between the animal patron and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
corresponding sex: among the Kurnai, all the men are believed to
be descended from Yeer&#365;ng and all the women from Djeetg&#365;n.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
The first observer to point out this curious institution described
it, in 1834, in the following terms: "Tilmun, a little bird the
size of a thrush (it is a sort of woodpecker), is supposed by the
women to be the first maker of women. These birds are held in
veneration by the women only."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> So it was a great ancestor.
But in other ways, this same totem resembles the individual
totem. In fact, it is believed that each member of a sexual
group is personally united to a determined individual of the
corresponding animal species. The two lives are so closely
associated that the death of the animal brings about that of the
man. "The life of a bat," say the Wotjobaluk, "is the life of a
man."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> That is why each sex not only respects its own totem,
but forces the members of the other to do so as well. Every
violation of this interdiction gives rise to actual bloody battles
between the men and the women.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the really original feature of these totems is that they
are, in a sense, a sort of tribal totems. In fact, they result from
men's representing the tribe as descended as a whole from one
couple of mythical beings. Such a belief seems to demonstrate
clearly that the tribal sentiment has acquired sufficient force
to resist, at least to a considerable extent, the particularism of
the clans. In regard to the distinct origins assigned to men
and to women, it must be said that its cause is to be sought in
the separate conditions in which the men and the women live.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how the sexual totems are
related to the totems of the clans, according to the theory of the
Australians, what relations there were between the two ancestors
thus placed at the commencement of the tribe, and from which
one each special clan is believed to be descended. But the ethnographical
data at our present disposal do not allow us to resolve
these questions. Moreover, however natural and even necessary
it may appear to us, it is very possible that the natives never
raised it. They do not feel the need of co-ordinating and systematizing
their beliefs as strongly as we do.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER V</b><br /><br />

<small>ORIGINS OF THESE BELIEFS</small><br /><br />

<i>Critical Examination of Preceding Theories</i></h3>


<p>The beliefs which we have just summarized are manifestly
of a religious nature, since they imply a division of things
into sacred and profane. It is certain that there is no thought
of spiritual beings, and in the course of our exposition we have
not even had occasion to pronounce the words, spirits, genii or
divine personalities. But if certain writers, of whom we shall
have something more to say presently, have, for this reason,
refused to regard totemism as a religion, it is because they have
an inexact notion of what religious phenomena are.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we are assured that this religion is the
most primitive one that is now observable and even, in all
probability, that has ever existed. In fact, it is inseparable from
a social organization on a clan basis. Not only is it impossible,
as we have already pointed out, to define it except in connection
with the clan, but it even seems as though the clan could not
exist, in the form it has taken in a great number of Australian
societies, without the totem. For the members of a single clan
are not united to each other either by a common habitat or
by common blood, as they are not necessarily consanguineous
and are frequently scattered over different parts of the tribal
territory. Their unity comes solely from their having the same
name and the same emblem, their believing that they have the
same relations with the same categories of things, their practising
the same rites, or, in a word, from their participating in the
same totemic cult. Thus totemism and the clan mutually imply
each other, in so far, at least, as the latter is not confounded with
the local group. Now the social organization on a clan basis is
the simplest which we know. In fact, it exists in all its essential
elements from the moment when the society includes two primary
clans; consequently, we may say that there are none more
rudimentary, as long as societies reduced to a single clan have
not been discovered, and we believe that up to the present no
traces of such have been found. A religion so closely connected
to a social system surpassing all others in simplicity may well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
be regarded as the most elementary religion we can possibly
know. If we succeed in discovering the origins of the beliefs
which we have just analysed, we shall very probably discover
at the same time the causes leading to the rise of the religious
sentiment in humanity.</p>

<p>But before treating this question for ourselves, we must examine
the most authorized solutions of it which have already been
proposed.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>In the first place, we find a group of scholars who believe
that they can account for totemism by deriving it from some
previous religion.</p>

<p>For Tylor<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> and Wilken,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> totemism is a special form of the
cult of the ancestors; it was the widespread doctrine of the
transmigration of souls that served as a bridge between these
two religious systems. A large number of peoples believe that
after death, the soul does not remain disincarnate for ever, but
presently animates another living body; on the other hand,
"the lower psychology, drawing no definite line of demarcation
between the souls of men and of beasts, can at least admit without
difficulty the transmigration of human souls into the bodies
of the lower animals."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Tylor cites a certain number of cases.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Under these circumstances, the religious respect inspired by the
ancestor is quite naturally attached to the animal or plant
with which he is presently confounded. The animal thus serving
as a receptacle for a venerated being becomes a holy thing, the
object of a cult, that is, a totem, for all the descendants of the
ancestor, who form the clan descended from him.</p>

<p>Facts pointed out by Wilken among the societies of the Malay
Archipelago would tend to prove that it really was in this manner
that the totemic beliefs originated. In Java and Sumatra,
crocodiles are especially honoured; they are regarded as benevolent
protectors who must not be killed; offerings are made to
them. Now the cult thus rendered to them is due to their being
supposed to incarnate the souls of ancestors. The Malays of
the Philippines consider the crocodile their grandfather; the
tiger is treated in the same way for the same reasons. Similar
beliefs have been observed among the Bantous.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> In Melanesia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
it sometimes happens that an influential man, at the moment of
death, announces his desire to reincarnate himself in a certain
animal or plant; it is easily understood how the object thus
chosen as his posthumous residence becomes sacred for his whole
family.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> So, far from being a primitive fact, totemism would
seem to be the product of a more complex religion which preceded
it.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>But the societies from which these facts were taken had
already arrived at a rather advanced stage of culture; in any
case, they had passed the stage of pure totemism. They have
families and not totemic clans.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Even the majority of the animals
to which religious honours are thus rendered are venerated, not
by special groups of families, but by the tribes as a whole. So
if these beliefs and practices do have some connection with
ancient totemic cults, they now represent only altered forms of
them<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and are consequently not very well fitted for showing
us their origins. It is not by studying an institution at the
moment when it is in full decadence that we can learn how it
was formed. If we want to know how totemism originated,
it is neither in Java nor Sumatra nor Melanesia that we must
study it, but in Australia. Here we find neither a cult of the
dead<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> nor the doctrine of transmigration. Of course they believe
that the mythical heroes, the founders of the clan, reincarnate
themselves periodically; <i>but this is in human bodies only</i>; each
birth, as we shall see, is the product of one of these reincarnations.
So if the animals of the totemic species are the object of rites, it
is not because the ancestral souls are believed to reside in them.
It is true that the first ancestors are frequently represented
under the form of an animal, and this very common representation
is an important fact for which we must account; but it was
not the belief in metempsychosis which gave it birth, for this
belief is unknown among Australian societies.</p>

<p>Moreover, far from being able to explain totemism, this
belief takes for granted one of the fundamental principles upon
which this rests; that is to say, it begs the question to be explained.
It, just as much as totemism, implies that man is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
considered a close relative of the animal; for if these two kingdoms
were clearly distinguished in the mind, men would never
believe that a human soul could pass so easily from one into
the other. It is even necessary that the body of the animal be
considered its true home, for it is believed to go there as soon as
it regains its liberty. Now while the doctrine of transmigration
postulates this singular affinity, it offers no explanation of it.
The only explanation offered by Tylor is that men sometimes
resemble in certain traits the anatomy and physiology of the
animal. "The half-human features and actions and characters
of animals are watched with wondering sympathy by the savage,
as by the child. The beast is the very incarnation of familiar
qualities of man: and such names as lion, bear, fox, owl, parrot,
viper, worm, when we apply them as epithets to men, condense
into a word some leading features of a human life."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> But even
if these resemblances are met with, they are uncertain and
exceptional; before all else, men resemble their relatives and
companions, and not plants and animals. Such rare and
questionable analogies could not overcome such unanimous
proofs, nor could they lead a man to think of himself and his
forefathers in forms contradicted by daily experience. So this
question remains untouched, and as long as it is not answered,
we cannot say that totemism is explained.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Finally, this whole theory rests upon a fundamental misunderstanding.
For Tylor as for Wundt, totemism is only a particular
case of the cult of animals.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> But we, on the contrary, know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
it is something very different from a sort of animal-worship.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
The animal is never adored; the man is nearly its equal and
sometimes even treats it as his possession, so far is he from being
subordinate to it like a believer before his god. If the animals
of the totemic species are really believed to incarnate the ancestors,
the members of foreign clans would not be allowed to eat their
flesh freely. In reality, it is not to the animal as such that the
cult is addressed, but to the emblem and the image of the totem.
Now between this religion of the emblem and the ancestor-cult,
there is no connection whatsoever.</p>


<p class="npara">While Tylor derives totemism from the ancestor-cult, Jevons
derives it from the nature-cult,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> and here is how he does so.</p>

<p>When, under the impulse of the surprise occasioned by the
irregularities observed in the course of phenomena, men had
once peopled the world with supernatural beings,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> they felt the
need of making agreements with these redoubtable forces with
which they had surrounded themselves. They understood that
the best way to escape being overwhelmed by them was to ally
themselves to some of them, and thus make sure of their aid. But
at this period of history men knew no other form of alliance
and association than the one resulting from kinship. All the
members of a single clan aid each other mutually because they
are kindred or, as amounts to the same thing, because they think
they are; on the other hand, different clans treat each other
as enemies because they are of different blood. So the only way
of assuring themselves of the support of these supernatural
beings was to adopt them as kindred and to be adopted by them
in the same quality: the well-known processes of the blood-covenant
permitted them to attain this result quite easily.
But since at this period, the individual did not yet have a real
personality, and was regarded only as a part of his group, or
clan, it was the clan as a whole, and not the individual, which
collectively contracted this relationship. For the same reason,
it was contracted, not with a particular object, but with the
natural group or species of which this object was a part; for
men think of the world as they think of themselves, and just
as they could not conceive themselves apart from their clans, so
they were unable to conceive of anything else as distinct from
the species to which it belonged. Now a species of things united
to a clan by a bond of kinship is, says Jevons, a totem.</p>

<p>In fact, it is certain that totemism implies the close association
of a clan to a determined category of objects. But that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
association was contracted with a deliberate design and in the
full consciousness of an end sought after, as Jevons would have
us believe, is a statement having but little harmony with what
history teaches. Religions are too complex, and answer to needs
that are too many and too obscure, to have their origin in a
premeditated act of the will. And while it sins through over-simplicity,
this hypothesis is also highly improbable. It says
that men sought to assure themselves of the aid of the supernatural
beings upon which things depend. Then they should
preferably have addressed themselves to the most powerful
of these, and to those whose protection promised to be the most
beneficial.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> But quite on the contrary, the beings with whom
they have formed this mystic kinship are often among the most
humble which exist. Also, if it were only a question of making
allies and defenders, they would have tried to make as many as
possible; for one cannot be defended too well. Yet as a matter
of fact, each clan systematically contents itself with a single
totem, that is to say, with one single protector, leaving the
other clans to enjoy their own in perfect liberty. Each group
confines itself within its own religious domain, never seeking to
trespass upon that of its neighbours. This reserve and moderation
are inexplicable according to the hypothesis under consideration.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Moreover, all these theories are wrong in omitting one question
which dominates the whole subject. We have seen that there
are two sorts of totemism: that of the individual and that of the
clan. There is too evident a kinship between the two for them
not to have some connection with each other. So we may well
ask if one is not derived from the other, and, in the case of an
affirmative answer, which is the more primitive; according to
the solution accepted, the problem of the origins of totemism
will be posed in different terms. This question becomes all the
more necessary because of its general interest. Individual
totemism is an individual aspect of the totemic cult. Then if it
was the primitive fact, we must say that religion is born in the
consciousness of the individual, that before all else, it answers to
individual aspirations, and that its collective form is merely
secondary.</p>

<p>The desire for an undue simplicity, with which ethnologists
and sociologists are too frequently inspired, has naturally led
many scholars to explain, here as elsewhere, the complex by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
simple, the totem of the group by that of the individual. Such,
in fact, is the theory sustained by Frazer in his <i>Golden Bough</i>,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
by Hill Tout,<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> by Miss Fletcher,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> by Boas<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> and by Swanton.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
It has the additional advantage of being in harmony with the
conception of religion which is currently held; this is quite
generally regarded as something intimate and personal. From
this point of view, the totem of the clan can only be an individual
totem which has become generalized. Some eminent man,
having found from experience the value of a totem he chose for
himself by his own free will, transmitted it to his descendants;
these latter, multiplying as time went on, finally formed the
extended family known as a clan, and thus the totem became
collective.</p>

<p>Hill Tout believes that he has found a proof supporting this
theory in the way totemism has spread among certain societies
of North-western America, especially among the Salish and
certain Indians on the Thompson River. Individual totemism
and the clan totemism are both found among these peoples;
but they either do not co-exist in the same tribe, or else, when
they do co-exist, they are not equally developed. They vary
in an inverse proportion to each other; where the clan totem
tends to become the general rule, the individual totem tends to
disappear, and <i>vice versa</i>. Is that not as much as to say that the
first is a more recent form of the second, which excludes it by
replacing it?<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Mythology seems to confirm this interpretation.
In these same societies, in fact, the ancestor of the clan is not a
totemic animal; the founder of the group is generally represented
in the form of a human being who, at a certain time,
had entered into familiar relations with a fabulous animal from
whom he received his totemic emblem. This emblem, together
with the special powers which are attached to it, was then passed
on to the descendants of this mythical hero by right of heritage.
So these people themselves seem to consider the collective
totem as an individual one, perpetuated in the same family.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Moreover, it still happens to-day that a father transmits his own
totem to his children. So if we imagine that the collective totem
had, in a general way, this same origin, we are assuming that the
same thing took place in the past which is still observable to-day.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>It is still to be explained whence the individual totem comes.
The reply given to this question varies with different authors.</p>

<p>Hill Tout considers it a particular case of fetishism. Feeling
himself surrounded on all sides by dreaded spirits, the individual
experienced that sentiment which we have just seen Jevons
attribute to the clan: in order that he might continue to exist,
he sought some powerful protector in this mysterious world.
Thus the use of a personal totem became established.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> For
Frazer, this same institution was rather a subterfuge or trick of
war, invented by men that they might escape from certain dangers.
It is known that according to a belief which is very widespread
in a large number of inferior societies, the human soul is able,
without great inconvenience, to quit the body it inhabits for a
while; howsoever far away it may be, it continues to animate
this body by a sort of detached control. Then, in certain critical
moments, when life is supposed to be particularly menaced, it
may be desirable to withdraw the soul from the body and lead
it to some place or into some object where it will be in greater
security. In fact, there are a certain number of practices whose
object is to withdraw the soul in order to protect it from some
danger, either real or imaginary. For example, at the moment
when men are going to enter a newly-built house, a magician
removes their souls and puts them in a sack, to be saved and
returned to their proprietors after the door-sill has been crossed.
This is because the moment when one enters a new house is
exceptionally critical; one may have disturbed, and consequently
offended, the spirits who reside in the ground and especially
under the sill, and if precautions are not taken, these could make
a man pay dearly for his audacity. But when this danger is
once passed, and one has been able to anticipate their anger
and even to make sure of their favour through the accomplishment
of certain rites, the souls may safely retake their accustomed
place.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> It is this same belief which gave birth to the personal
totem. To protect themselves from sorcery, men thought it
wise to hide their souls in the anonymous crowd of some species
of animal or vegetable. But after these relations had once been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
established, each individual found himself closely united to the
animal or plant where his own vital principle was believed to
reside. Two beings so closely united were finally thought to be
practically indistinguishable: men believed that each participated
in the nature of the other. When this belief had once
been accepted, it facilitated and hastened the transformation
of the personal totem into an hereditary, and consequently a
collective, totem; for it seemed quite evident that this kinship of
nature should be transmitted hereditarily from father to child.</p>

<p>We shall not stop to discuss these two explanations of the
individual totem at length: they are ingenious fabrications of
the mind, but they completely lack all positive proof. If we are
going to reduce totemism to fetishism, we must first establish
that the latter is prior to the former; now, not merely is no fact
brought forward to support this hypothesis, but it is even contradicted
by everything that we know. The ill-determined group
of rites going under the name of fetishism seem to appear only
among peoples who have already attained to a certain degree of
civilization; but it is a species of cult unknown in Australia. It
is true that some have described the churinga as a fetish;<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> but
even supposing that this qualification were justified, it would
not prove the priority which is postulated. Quite on the contrary,
the churinga presupposes totemism, since it is essentially an
instrument of the totemic cult and owes the virtues attributed
to it to totemic beliefs alone.</p>

<p>As for the theory of Frazer, it presupposes a thoroughgoing
idiocy on the part of the primitive which known facts do not
allow us to attribute to him. He does have a logic, however
strange this may at times appear; now unless he were completely
deprived of it, he could never be guilty of the reasoning imputed
to him. Nothing could be more natural than that he should
believe it possible to assure the survival of his soul by hiding it
in a secret and inaccessible place, as so many heroes of myths
and legends are said to have done. But why should he think it
safer in the body of an animal than in his own? Of course, if it
were thus lost in space, it might have a chance to escape the
spells of a magician more readily, but at the same time it would
be prepared for the blows of hunters. It is a strange way of
sheltering it to place it in a material form exposing it to risks at
every instant.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> But above all, it is inconceivable that a whole
people should allow themselves to be carried into such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
aberration.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Finally, in a very large number of cases, the function
of the individual totem is very different from that assigned it by
Frazer; before all else, it is a means of conferring extraordinary
powers upon magicians, hunters or warriors.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> As to the kinship
of the man and the thing, with all the inconveniences it implies,
it is accepted as a consequence of the rite; but it is not desired
in its and for itself.</p>

<p>There is still less occasion for delaying over this controversy
since it concerns no real problem. What we must know before
everything else is whether or not the individual totem is really
a primitive fact, from which the collective totem was derived;
for, according to the reply given to this question, we must seek
the home of the religious life in one or the other of two opposite
directions.</p>

<p>Against the hypothesis of Hill Tout, Miss Fletcher, Boas and
Frazer there is such an array of decisive facts that one is surprised
that it has been so readily and so generally accepted.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know that a man frequently has the
greatest interest not only in respecting, but also in making his
companions respect the species serving him as personal totem;
his own life is connected with it. Then if collective totemism
were only a generalized form of individual totemism, it too
should repose upon this same principle. Not only should the
men of a clan abstain from killing and eating their totem-animal
themselves, but they should also do all in their power to force
this same abstention upon others. But as a matter of fact, far
from imposing such a renunciation upon the whole tribe, each
clan, by rites which we shall describe below, takes care that the
plant or animal whose name it bears shall increase and prosper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
so as to assure an abundant supply of food for the other clans.
So we must at least admit that in becoming collective, individual
totemism was transformed profoundly, and we must therefore
account for this transformation.</p>

<p>In the second place, how is it possible to explain, from this
point of view, the fact that except where totemism is in full
decay, two clans of a single tribe always have different totems?
It seems that nothing prevents two or several members of a
single tribe, even when there is no kinship between them, from
choosing their personal totem in the same animal species and
passing it on to their descendants. Does it not happen to-day
that two distinct families have the same name? The carefully
regulated way in which the totems and sub-totems are divided
up, first between the two phratries and then among the various
clans of the phratry, obviously presupposes a social agreement
and a collective organization. This is as much as to say that
totemism is something more than an individual practice spontaneously
generalized.</p>

<p>Moreover, collective totemism cannot be deduced from individual
totemism except by a misunderstanding of the differences
separating the two. The one is acquired by the child at birth;
it is a part of his civil status. The other is acquired during the
course of his life; it presupposes the accomplishment of a
determined rite and a change of condition. Some seek to diminish
this distance by inserting between the two, as a sort of middle
term, the right of each possessor of a totem to transmit it to
whomsoever he pleases. But wherever these transfers do take
place, they are rare and relatively exceptional acts; they cannot
be performed except by magicians or other personages invested
with special powers;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> in any case, they are possible only through
ritual ceremonies which bring about the change. So it is necessary
to explain how this prerogative of a few became the right of all;
how that which at first implied a profound change in the religious
and moral constitution of the individual, was able to become an
element of this constitution; and finally, how a transmission
which at first was the consequence of a rite was later believed to
operate automatically from the nature of things and without the
intervention of any human will.</p>

<p>In support of his interpretation, Hill Tout claims that certain
myths give the totem of the clan an individual origin: they
tell how the totemic emblem was acquired by some special
individual, who then transmitted it to his descendants. But in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the first place, it is to be remarked that these myths are all taken
from the Indian tribes of North America, which are societies
arrived at a rather high degree of culture. How could a
mythology so far removed from the origins of things aid in
reconstituting the primitive form of an institution with any
degree of certainty? There are many chances for intermediate
causes to have gravely disfigured the recollection which these
people have been able to retain. Moreover, it is very easy to
answer these myths with others, which seem much more primitive
and whose signification is quite different. The totem is there
represented as the very being from whom the clan is descended.
So it must be that it constitutes the substance of the clan; men
have it within them from their birth; it is a part of their very
flesh and blood, so far are they from having received it from
without.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> More than that, the very myths upon which Hill
Tout relies contain an echo of this ancient conception. The
founder who gave his name to the clan certainly had a human
form; but he was a man who, after living among animals of a certain
species, finally came to resemble them. This is undoubtedly
because a time came when the mind was too cultivated to admit
any longer, as it had formerly done, that men might have been
born of animals; so the animal ancestor, now become inconceivable,
is replaced by a human being; but the idea persists
that this man had acquired certain characteristics of the animal
either by imitation or by some other process. Thus even this late
mythology bears the mark of a more remote epoch when the totem
of the clan was never regarded as a sort of individual creation.</p>

<p>But this hypothesis does not merely raise grave logical difficulties;
it is contradicted directly by the following facts.</p>

<p>If individual totemism were the initial fact, it should be more
developed and apparent, the more primitive the societies are,
and inversely, it should lose ground and disappear before the
other among the more advanced peoples. Now it is the contrary
which is true. The Australian tribes are far behind those of
North America; yet Australia is the classic land of collective
totemism. <i>In the great majority of the tribes, it alone is found,
while we do not know a single one where individual totemism alone
is practised.</i><a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> This latter is found in a characteristic form only
in an infinitesimal number of tribes.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Even where it is met with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it is generally in a rudimentary form. It is made up of individual
and optional practices having no generality. Only magicians
are acquainted with the art of creating mysterious relationships
with species of animals to which they are not related by nature.
Ordinary people do not enjoy this privilege.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> In America, on
the contrary, the collective totem is in full decadence; in the
societies of the North-west especially, its religious character is
almost gone. Inversely, the individual totem plays a considerable
r&ocirc;le among these same peoples. A very great efficacy is attributed
to it; it has become a real public institution. This is because
it is the sign of a higher civilization. This is undoubtedly the
explanation of the inversion of these two forms of totemism,
which Hill Tout believes he has observed among the Salish.
If in those parts where collective totemism is the most fully
developed the other form is almost lacking, it is not because the
second has disappeared before the first, but rather, because the
conditions necessary for its existence have not yet been fully
realized.</p>

<p>But a fact which is still more conclusive is that individual
totemism, far from having given birth to the totemism of the
clan, presupposes this latter. It is within the frame of collective
totemism that it is born and lives: it is an integral part of it.
In fact, in those very societies where it is preponderating, the
novices do not have the right of taking any animal as their
individual totem; to each clan a certain definite number of
species are assigned, outside of which it may not choose. In
return, those belonging to it thus are its exclusive property;
members of other clans may not usurp them.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> They are thought
to have relations of close dependence upon the one serving as
totem to the clan as a whole. There are even cases where it is
quite possible to observe these relations: the individual aspect
represents a part or a particular aspect of the collective totem.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Among the Wotjobaluk, each member of the clan considers the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
personal totems of his companions as being his own after a fashion;<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
so they are probably sub-totems. Now the sub-totem supposes
the totem, as the species supposes the class. Thus the first form
of individual religion met with in history appears, not as the
active principle of all public religion, but, on the contrary,
as a simple aspect of this latter. The cult which the individual
organizes for himself in his own inner conscience, far from being
the germ of the collective cult, is only this latter adapted to the
personal needs of the individual.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>In a more recent study,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> which the works of Spencer and
Gillen suggested to him, Frazer has attempted to substitute a
new explanation of totemism for the one he first proposed,
and which we have just been discussing. It rests on the postulate
that the totemism of the Arunta is the most primitive which we
know; Frazer even goes so far as to say that it scarcely differs
from the really and absolutely original type.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>The singular thing about it is that the totems are attached
neither to persons nor to determined groups of persons, but to
localities. In fact, each totem has its centre at some definite
spot. It is there that the souls of the first ancestors, who founded
the totemic group at the beginning of time, are believed to have
their preferred residence. It is there that the sanctuary is located
where the churinga are kept; there the cult is celebrated. It is
also this geographical distribution of totems which determines
the manner in which the clans are recruited. The child has
neither the totem of his father nor that of his mother, but the
one whose centre is at the spot where the mother believes that
she felt the first symptoms of approaching maternity. For it is
said that the Arunta is ignorant of the exact relation existing
between generation and the sexual act;<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> he thinks that every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
conception is due to a sort of mystic fecundation. According
to him, it is due to the entrance of the soul of an ancestor into
the body of a woman and its becoming the principle of a new
life there. So at the moment when a woman feels the first
tremblings of the child, she imagines that one of the souls whose
principal residence is at the place where she happens to be, has
just entered into her. As the child who is presently born is merely
the reincarnation of this ancestor, he necessarily has the same
totem; thus his totem is determined by the locality where he is
believed to have been mysteriously conceived.</p>

<p>Now, it is this local totemism which represents the original
form of totemism; at most, it is separated from this by a very
short step. This is how Frazer explains its genesis.</p>

<p>At the exact moment when the woman realizes that she is
pregnant, she must think that the spirit by which she feels
herself possessed has come to her from the objects about her,
and especially from one of those which attract her attention at
the moment. So if she is engaged in plucking a plant, or watching
an animal, she believes that the soul of this plant or animal has
passed into her. Among the things to which she will be particularly
inclined to attribute her condition are, in the first place, the
things she has just eaten. If she has recently eaten emu or yam,
she will not doubt that an emu or yam has been born in her and
is developing. Under these conditions, it is evident how the
child, in his turn, will be considered a sort of yam or emu, how
he regards himself as a relative of the plant or animal of the
same species, how he has sympathy and regard for them, how he
refuses to eat them, etc.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> From this moment, totemism exists
in its essential traits: it is the native's theory of conception
that gave rise to it, so Frazer calls this primitive totemism
<i>conceptional</i>.</p>

<p>It is from this original type that all the other forms of totemism
are derived. "When several women had, one after the other,
felt the first premonitions of maternity at the same spot and
under the same circumstances, the place would come to be regarded
as haunted by spirits of a peculiar sort; and so the
whole country might in time be dotted over with totem centres
and distributed into totem districts."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> This is how the local
totemism of the Arunta originated. In order that the totems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
may subsequently be detached from their territorial base, it is
sufficient to think that the ancestral souls, instead of remaining
immutably fixed to a determined spot, are able to move freely
over the surface of the territory and that in their voyages they
follow the men and women of the same totem as themselves.
In this way, a woman may be impregnated by her own totem
or that of her husband, though residing in a different totemic
district. According to whether it is believed that it is the ancestor
of the husband or of the wife who thus follow the family about,
seeking occasions to reincarnate themselves, the totem of the
child will be that of his father or mother. In fact, it is in just
this way that the Guanji and Umbaia on the one hand, and the
Urabunna on the other, explain their systems of filiation.</p>

<p>But this theory, like that of Tylor, rests upon a begging of the
question. If he is to imagine that human souls are the souls of
animals or plants, one must believe beforehand that men take
either from the animal or vegetable world whatever is most
essential in them. Now this belief is one of those at the foundation
of totemism. To state it as something evident is therefore
to take for granted that which is to be explained.</p>

<p>Moreover, from this point of view, the religious character of
the totem is entirely inexplicable, for the vague belief in an
obscure kinship between the man and the animal is not enough
to found a cult. This confusion of distinct kingdoms could never
result in dividing the world into sacred and profane. It is true
that, being consistent with himself, Frazer refuses to admit that
totemism is a religion, under the pretext that he finds in it neither
spiritual beings, nor prayers, nor invocations, nor offerings, etc.
According to him, it is only a system of magic, by which he means
a sort of crude and erroneous science, a first effort to discover the
laws of things.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> But we know how inexact this conception,
both of magic and of religion, is. We have a religion as soon
as the sacred is distinguished from the profane, and we have
seen that totemism is a vast system of sacred things. If we are
to explain it, we must therefore show how it happened that these
things were stamped with this character.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> But he does not
even raise this problem.</p>

<p>But this system is completely overthrown by the fact that
the postulate upon which it rests can no longer be sustained.
The whole argument of Frazer supposes that the local totemism
of the Arunta is the most primitive we know, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>that it is clearly prior to hereditary totemism, either in the
paternal or the maternal line. Now as soon as the facts contained
in the first volume of Spencer and Gillen were at our disposal,
we were able to conjecture that there had been a time in the
history of the Arunta people when the totems, instead of being
attached to localities, were transmitted hereditarily from mother
to child.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> This conjecture is definitely proved by the new
facts discovered by Strehlow,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> which only confirm the previous
observations of Schulze.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> In fact, both of these authors tell us
that even now, in addition to his local totem, each Arunta has
another which is completely independent of all geographical
conditions, and which belongs to him as a birthright: it is his
mother's. This second totem, just like the first, is considered
a powerful friend and protector by the natives, which looks
after their food, warns them of possible dangers, etc. They
have the right of taking part in its cult. When they are buried,
the corpse is laid so that the face is turned towards the region
of the maternal totemic centre. So after a fashion this centre
is also that of the deceased. In fact it is given the name <i>tmara
altjira</i>, which is translated: camp of the totem which is associated
with me. So it is certain that among the Arunta, hereditary
totemism in the uterine line is not later than local totemism,
but, on the contrary, must have preceded it. For to-day, the
maternal totem has only an accessory and supplementary r&ocirc;le;
it is a second totem, which explains how it was able to escape
observation as attentive and careful as that of Spencer and
Gillen. But in order that it should be able to retain this secondary
place, being employed along with the local totem, there must
have been a time when it held the primary place in the religious
life. It is, in part, a fallen totem, but one recalling an epoch when
the totemic organization of the Arunta was very different from
what it is to-day. So the whole superstructure of Frazer's system
is undermined at its foundation.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Although Andrew Lang has actively contested this theory
of Frazer's, the one he proposes himself in his later works,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
resembles it on more than one point. Like Frazer, he makes
totemism consist in the belief in a sort of consubstantiality of
the man and the animal. But he explains it differently.</p>

<p>He derives it entirely from the fact that the totem is a name.
As soon as human groups were founded,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> each one felt the need
of distinguishing between the neighbouring groups with which it
came into contact and, with this end in view, it gave them different
names. The names were preferably chosen from the surrounding
flora and fauna because animals and plants can easily be designated
by movements or represented by drawings.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> The more
or less precise resemblances which men may have with such and
such objects determined the way in which these collective
denominations were distributed among the groups.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Now, it is a well-known fact that "to the early mind names,
and the things known by names, are in a mystic and transcendental
connection of <i>rapport</i>."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> For example, the name of an individual
is not considered as a simple word or conventional sign, but as
an essential part of the individual himself. So if it were the
name of an animal, the man would have to believe that he
himself had the most characteristic attributes of this same animal.
This theory would become better and better accredited as the
historic origins of these denominations became more remote
and were effaced from the memory. Myths arose to make this
strange ambiguity of human nature more easily representable
in the mind. To explain this, they imagined that the animal
was the ancestor of the men, or else that the two were descended
from a common ancestor. Thus came the conception of bonds
of kinship uniting each clan to the animal species whose name
it bore. With the origins of this fabulous kinship once explained,
it seems to our author that totemism no longer contains a
mystery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>But whence comes the religious character of the totemic
beliefs and practices? For the fact that a man considers himself
an animal of a certain species does not explain why he attributes
marvellous powers to this species, and especially why he renders
a cult to the images symbolizing it.&mdash;To this question Lang gives
the same response as Frazer: he denies that totemism is a religion.
"I find in Australia," he says, "no example of religious practices
such as praying to, nourishing or burying the totem."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> It was
only at a later epoch, when it was already established, that
totemism was drawn into and surrounded by a system of conceptions
properly called religious. According to a remark of
Howitt,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> when the natives undertake the explanation of the
totemic institutions, they do not attribute them to the totems
themselves nor to a man, but to some supernatural being such
as Bunjil or Baiame. "Accepting this evidence," says Lang,
"one source of the 'religious' character of totemism is at once
revealed. The totemist obeys the decree of Bunjil, or Baiame, as
the Cretans obeyed the divine decrees given by Zeus to Minos."
Now according to Lang the idea of these great divinities arose
outside of the totemic system; so this is not a religion in itself;
it has merely been given a religious colouring by contact with a
genuine religion.</p>

<p>But these very myths contradict Lang's conception of totemism.
If the Australians had regarded totemism as something human
and profane, it would never have occurred to them to make a
divine institution out of it. If, on the other hand, they have
felt the need of connecting it with a divinity, it is because they
have seen a sacred character in it. So these mythological interpretations
prove the religious nature of totemism, but do not
explain it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Lang himself recognizes that this solution is not
sufficient. He realizes that totemic things are treated with a
religious respect;<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> that especially the blood of an animal, as
well as that of a man, is the object of numerous interdictions, or,
as he says, taboos which this comparatively late mythology
cannot explain.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Then where do they come from? Here are
the words with which Lang answers this question: "As soon as
the animal-named groups evolved the universally diffused
beliefs about the <i>wakan</i> or <i>mana</i>, or mystically sacred quality
of the blood as the life, they would also develop the various
taboos."<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The words <i>wakan</i> and <i>mana</i>, as we shall see in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
following chapter, involve the very idea of <i>sacredness</i> itself; the
one is taken from the language of the Sioux, the other from that
of the Melanesian peoples. To explain the sacred character of
totemic things by postulating this characteristic, is to answer the
question by the question. What we must find out is whence this
idea of <i>wakan</i> comes and how it comes to be applied to the totem
and all that is derived from it. As long as these two questions
remain unanswered, nothing is explained.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>We have now passed in review all the principal explanations
which have been given for totemic beliefs,<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> leaving to each of
them its own individuality. But now that this examination is
finished, we may state one criticism which addresses itself to all
these systems alike.</p>

<p>If we stick to the letter of the formul&aelig;, it seems that these
may be arranged in two groups. Some (Frazer, Lang) deny the
religious character of totemism; in reality, that amounts to
denying the facts. Others recognize this, but think that they
can explain it by deriving it from an anterior religion out of
which totemism developed. But as a matter of fact, this distinction
is only apparent: the first group is contained within the
second. Neither Frazer nor Lang have been able to maintain
their principle systematically and explain totemism as if it were
not a religion. By the very force of facts, they have been compelled
to slip ideas of a religious nature into their explanations.
We have just seen how Lang calls in the idea of sacredness, which
is the cardinal idea of all religion. Frazer, on his side, in each of
the theories which he has successively proposed, appeals openly
to the idea of souls or spirits; for according to him, totemism
came from the fact that men thought they could deposit their
souls in safety in some external object, or else that they attributed
conception to a sort of spiritual fecundation of which a spirit
was the agent. Now a soul, and still more, a spirit, are sacred
things and the object of rites; so the ideas expressing them are
essentially religious and it is therefore in vain that Frazer makes
totemism a mere system of magic, for he succeeds in explaining
it only in the terms of another religion.</p>

<p>We have already pointed out the insufficiencies of animism
and naturism; so one may not have recourse to them, as Tylor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and Jevons do, without exposing himself to these same objections.
Yet neither Frazer nor Lang seems to dream of the possibility
of another hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> On the other hand, we know that totemism
is tightly bound up with the most primitive social system which
we know, and in all probability, of which we can conceive. To
suppose that it has developed out of another religion, differing
from it only in degree, is to leave the data of observation and
enter into the domain of arbitrary and unverifiable conjectures.
If we wish to remain in harmony with the results we have already
obtained, it is necessary that while affirming the religious nature
of totemism, we abstain from deriving it from another different
religion. There can be no hope of assigning it non-religious ideas
as its cause. But among the representations entering into the
conditions from which it results, there may be some which directly
suggest a religious nature of themselves. These are the ones we
must look for.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER VI</b><br /><br />

<small>ORIGINS OF THESE BELIEFS&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

<i>The Notion of the Totemic Principle, or Mana, and the
Idea of Force</i></h3>


<p>Since individual totemism is later than the totemism of the
clan, and even seems to be derived from it, it is to this
latter form that we must turn first of all. But as the analysis
which we have just made of it has resolved it into a multiplicity
of beliefs which may appear quite heterogeneous, before going
farther, we must seek to learn what makes its unity.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>We have seen that totemism places the figured representations
of the totem in the first rank of the things it considers sacred;
next come the animals or vegetables whose name the clan bears,
and finally the members of the clan. Since all these things are
sacred in the same way, though to different degrees, their religious
character can be due to none of the special attributes
distinguishing them from each other. If a certain species of
animal or vegetable is the object of a reverential fear, this is not
because of its special properties, for the human members of the
clan enjoy this same privilege, though to a slightly inferior
degree, while the mere image of this same plant or animal inspires
an even more pronounced respect. The similar sentiments
inspired by these different sorts of things in the mind of the
believer, which give them their sacred character, can evidently
come only from some common principle partaken of alike by the
totemic emblems, the men of the clan and the individuals of the
species serving as totem. In reality, it is to this common principle
that the cult is addressed. In other words totemism is the religion,
not of such and such animals or men or images, but of an anonymous
and impersonal force, found in each of these beings but
not to be confounded with any of them. No one possesses it
entirely and all participate in it. It is so completely independent
of the particular subjects in whom it incarnates itself, that it
precedes them and survives them. Individuals die, generations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
pass and are replaced by others; but this force always remains
actual, living and the same. It animates the generations of to-day
as it animated those of yesterday and as it will animate
those of to-morrow. Taking the words in a large sense, we may
say that it is the god adored by each totemic cult. Yet it is an
impersonal god, without name or history, immanent in the world
and diffused in an innumerable multitude of things.</p>

<p>But even now we have only an imperfect idea of the real
ubiquity of this quasi-divine entity. It is not merely found in
the whole totemic species, the whole clan and all the objects
symbolizing the totem: the circle of its action extends beyond
that. In fact, we have seen that in addition to the eminently
holy things, all those attributed to the clan as dependencies of
the principal totem have this same character to a certain degree.
They also have something religious about them, for some are
protected by interdictions, while others have determined functions
in the ceremonies of the cult. Their religiousness does not differ
in kind from that of the totem under which they are classified;
it must therefore be derived from the same source. So it is
because the totemic god&mdash;to use again the metaphorical expression
which we have just employed&mdash;is in them, just as it is in the
species serving as totem and in the men of the clan. We may
see how much it differs from the beings in which it resides from
the fact that it is the soul of so many different beings.</p>

<p>But the Australian does not represent this impersonal force
in an abstract form. Under the influence of causes which we
must seek, he has been led to conceive it under the form of an
animal or vegetable species, or, in a word, of a visible object
This is what the totem really consists in: it is only the material
form under which the imagination represents this immaterial
substance, this energy diffused through all sorts of heterogeneous
things, which alone is the real object of the cult. We are now
in a better condition for understanding what the native means
when he says that the men of the Crow phratry, for example, are
crows. He does not exactly mean to say that they are crows in
the vulgar and empiric sense of the term, but that the same
principle is found in all of them, which is their most essential
characteristic, which they have in common with the animals of
the same name and which is thought of under the external form of
a crow. Thus the universe, as totemism conceives it, is filled and
animated by a certain number of forces which the imagination
represents in forms taken, with only a few exceptions, from the
animal or vegetable kingdoms: there are as many of them as there
are clans in the tribe, and each of them is also found in certain
categories of things, of which it is the essence and vital principle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>When we say that these principles are forces, we do not take
the word in a metaphorical sense; they act just like veritable
forces. In one sense, they are even material forces which mechanically
engender physical effects. Does an individual come in contact
with them without having taken proper precautions? He
receives a shock which might be compared to the effect of an
electric discharge. Sometimes they seem to conceive of these
as a sort of fluid escaping by points.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> If they are introduced
into an organism not made to receive them, they produce sickness
and death by a wholly automatic action.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Outside of men,
they play the r&ocirc;le of vital principle; it is by acting on them,
we shall see,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> that the reproduction of the species is assured. It
is upon them that the universal life reposes.</p>

<p>But in addition to this physical aspect, they also have a moral
character. When someone asks a native why he observes his
rites, he replies that his ancestors always have observed them,
and he ought to follow their example.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> So if he acts in a certain
way towards the totemic beings, it is not only because the forces
resident in them are physically redoubtable, but because he feels
himself morally obliged to act thus; he has the feeling that he
is obeying an imperative, that he is fulfilling a duty. For these
sacred beings, he has not merely fear, but also respect. Moreover,
the totem is the source of the moral life of the clan. All the
beings partaking of the same totemic principle consider that
owing to this very fact, they are morally bound to one another;
they have definite duties of assistance, vendetta, etc., towards
each other; and it is these duties which constitute kinship.
So while the totemic principle is a totemic force, it is also a moral
power; so we shall see how it easily transforms itself into a
divinity properly so-called.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is nothing here which is special to totemism.
Even in the most advanced religions, there is scarcely a god who
has not kept something of this ambiguity and whose functions
are not at once cosmic and moral. At the same time that it is
a spiritual discipline, every religion is also a means enabling
men to face the world with greater confidence. Even for the
Christian, is not God the Father the guardian of the physical
order as well as the legislator and the judge of human conduct?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Perhaps someone will ask whether, in interpreting totemism
thus, we do not endow the native with ideas surpassing the
limits of his intellect. Of course we are not prepared to affirm
that he represents these forces with the relative clarity which we
have been able to give to them in our analysis. We are able
to show quite clearly that this notion is implied by the whole
system of beliefs which it dominates; but we are unable to say
how far it is conscious and how far, on the contrary, it is only
implicit and confusedly felt. There is no way of determining just
what degree of clarity an idea like this may have in obscure
minds. But it is well shown, in any case, that this in no way
surpasses the capacities of the primitive mind, and on the contrary,
the results at which we have just arrived are confirmed
by the fact that either in the societies closely related to these
Australian tribes, or even in these tribes themselves, we find, in
an explicit form, conceptions which differ from the preceding
only by shades and degrees.</p>

<p>The native religions of Samoa have certainly passed the
totemic phase. Real gods are found there, who have their own
names, and, to a certain degree, their own personal physiognomy.
Yet the traces of totemism are hardly contestable. In fact, each
god is attached to a group, either local or domestic, just as the
totem is to its clan.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Then, each of these gods is thought of as
immanent in a special species of animal. But this does not mean
that he resides in one subject in particular: he is immanent in
all at once; he is diffused in the species as a whole. When an
animal dies, the men of the group who venerate it weep for it
and render pious duties to it, because a god inhabits it; but the
god is not dead. He is eternal, like the species. He is not even
confused with the present generation; he has already been the
soul of the preceding one, as he will be the soul of the one which
is to follow.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> So he has all the characteristics of the totemic
principle. He is the totemic principle, re-clothed in a slightly
personal form by the imagination. But still, we must not
exaggerate a personality which is hardly reconcilable with this
diffusion and ubiquity. If its contours were clearly defined, it
could never spread out thus and enter into such a multitude of
things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>However, it is incontestable that in this case the idea of an
impersonal religious force is beginning to change; but there
are other cases where it is affirmed in all its abstract purity and
even reaches a higher degree of generality than in Australia.
If the different totemic principles to which the various clans of
a single tribe address themselves are distinct from each other,
they are, none the less, comparable to each other at bottom;
for all play the same r&ocirc;le in their respective spheres. There are
societies which have had the feeling of this unity with nature
and have consequently advanced to the idea of a unique religious
force of which all other sacred principles are only expressions and
which makes the unity of the universe. As these societies are
still thoroughly impregnated with totemism, and as they remain
entangled in a social organization identical with that of the
Australians, we may say that totemism contained this idea in
potentiality.</p>

<p>This can be observed in a large number of American tribes,
especially those belonging to the great Sioux family: the Omaha,
Ponka, Kansas, Osage, Assiniboin, Dakota, Iowa, Winnebago,
Mandan, Hidatsa, etc. Many of these are still organized in clans,
as the Omaha<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> and the Iowa;<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> others were so not long since,
and, says Dorsey, it is still possible to find among them "all the
foundations of the totemic system, just as in the other societies
of the Sioux."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Now among these peoples, above all the particular
deities to whom men render a cult, there is a pre-eminent
power to which all the others have the relation of derived forms,
and which is called <i>wakan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Owing to the preponderating place
thus assigned to this principle in the Siouan pantheon, it is sometimes
regarded as a sort of sovereign god, or a Jupiter or Jahveh,
and travellers have frequently translated wakan by "great
spirit." This is misrepresenting its real nature gravely. The
wakan is in no way a personal being; the natives do not represent
it in a determined form. According to an observer cited by
Dorsey, "they say that they have never seen the wakanda, so
they cannot pretend to personify it."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> It is not even possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to define it by determined attributes and characteristics. "No
word," says Riggs, "can explain the meaning of this term among
the Dakota. It embraces all mystery, all secret power, all
divinity."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> All the beings which the Dakota reveres, "the earth,
the four winds, the sun, the moon and the stars, are manifestations
of this mysterious life and power" which enters into all.
Sometimes it is represented in the form of a wind, as a breath
having its seat in the four cardinal points and moving everything:<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
sometimes it is a voice heard in the crashing of the
thunder;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> the sun, moon and stars are wakan.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> But no enumeration
could exhaust this infinitely complex idea. It is not a definite
and definable power, the power of doing this or that; it is Power
in an absolute sense, with no epithet or determination of any
sort. The various divine powers are only particular manifestations
and personifications of it; each of them is this power seen
under one of its numerous aspects.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> It is this which made one
observer say, "He is a protean god; he is supposed to appear
to different persons in different forms."<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Nor are the gods the
only beings animated by it: it is the principle of all that lives or
acts or moves. "All life is wakan. So also is everything which
exhibits power, whether in action, as the winds and drifting
clouds, or in passive endurance, as the boulder by the wayside."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Among the Iroquois, whose social organization has an even
more pronouncedly totemic character, this, same idea is found
again; the word <i>orenda</i> which expresses it is the exact equivalent
of the wakan of the Sioux. "The savage man," says Hewitt,
"conceived the diverse bodies collectively constituting his environment
to possess inherently mystic potence ... (whether
they be) the rocks, the waters, the tides, the plants and the trees,
the animals and man, the wind and the storms, the clouds and
the thunders and the lightnings,"<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> etc. "This potence is held
to be the property of all things ... and by the inchoate mentation
of man is regarded as the efficient cause of all phenomena, all
the activities of his environment."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> A sorcerer or shaman has
orenda, but as much would be said of a man succeeding in his
enterprises. At bottom, there is nothing in the world which does
not have its quota of orenda; but the quantities vary. There are
some beings, either men or things, which are favoured; there are
others which are relatively disinherited, and the universal life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
consists in the struggles of these orenda of unequal intensity.
The more intense conquer the weaker. Is one man more successful
than his companions in the hunt or at war? It is because he
has more orenda. If an animal escapes from a hunter who is
pursuing it, it is because the orenda of the former was the more
powerful.</p>

<p>This same idea is found among the Shoshone under the name
of <i>pokunt</i>, among the Algonquin under the name of <i>manitou</i>,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> of
<i>nauala</i> among the Kwakiutl,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> of <i>yek</i> among the Tlinkit<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> and of
<i>sg&acirc;na</i> among the Haida.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> But it is not peculiar to the Indians
of North America; it is in Melanesia that it was studied for the
first time. It is true that in certain of the islands of Melanesia,
social organization is no longer on a totemic basis; but in all,
totemism is still visible,<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> in spite of what Codrington has said
about it. Now among these peoples, we find, under the name of
<i>mana</i>, an idea which is the exact equivalent of the wakan of the
Sioux and the orenda of the Iroquois. The definition given by
Codrington is as follows: "There is a belief in a force altogether
distinct from physical power, which acts in all ways for good and
evil; and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control.
This is Mana. I think I know what our people mean by it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... It is a power or influence, not physical and in a way supernatural;</span><br />
but it shows itself in physical force, or in any kind of
power or excellence which a man possesses. This mana is not
fixed in anything, and can be conveyed in almost anything.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... All Melanesian religion consists, in fact, in getting this</span><br />
mana for one's self, or getting it used for one's benefit."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Is this
not the same notion of an anonymous and diffused force, the
germs of which we recently found in the totemism of Australia?
Here is the same impersonality; for, as Codrington says, we must
be careful not to regard it as a sort of supreme being; any such
idea is "absolutely foreign" to Melanesian thought. Here is
the same ubiquity; the mana is located nowhere definitely and
it is everywhere. All forms of life and all the effects of the action,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
either of men or of living beings or of simple minerals, are attributed
to its influence.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Therefore there is no undue temerity in attributing to the
Australians an idea such as the one we have discovered in our
analysis of totemic beliefs, for we find it again, but abstracted
and generalized to a higher degree, at the basis of other religions
whose roots go back into a system like the Australian one and
which visibly bear the mark of this. The two conceptions
are obviously related; they differ only in degree, while the
mana is diffused into the whole universe, what we call the god
or, to speak more precisely, the totemic principle, is localized in
the more limited circle of the beings and things of certain species.
It is mana, but a little more specialized; yet as a matter of fact,
this specialization is quite relative.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is one case where this connection is made
especially apparent. Among the Omaha, there are totems of
all sorts, both individual and collective;<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> but both are only
particular forms of wakan. "The foundation of the Indian's
faith in the efficacy of the totem," says Miss Fletcher, "rested
upon his belief concerning nature and life. This conception was
complex and involved two prominent ideas: First, that all
things, animate and inanimate, were permeated by a common
life; and second, that this life could not be broken, but was
continuous."<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Now this common principle of life is the wakan.
The totem is the means by which an individual is put into relations
with this source of energy; if the totem has any powers, it is
because it incarnates the wakan. If a man who has violated the
interdictions protecting his totem is struck by sickness or death,
it is because this mysterious force against which he has thus
set himself, that is, the wakan, reacts against him with a force
proportionate to the shock received.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Also, just as the totem is
wakan, so the wakan, in its turn, sometimes shows its totemic
origin by the way in which it is conceived. In fact, Say says that
among the Dakota the "wahconda" is manifested sometimes
in the form of a grey bear, sometimes of a bison, a beaver or
some other animal.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Undoubtedly, this formula cannot be
accepted without reserve. The wakan repels all personification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and consequently it is hardly probable that it has ever been
thought of in its abstract generality with the aid of such definite
symbols. But Say's remark is probably applicable to the
particular forms which it takes in specializing itself in the concrete
reality of life. Now if there is a possibility that there was a time
when these specializations of the wakan bore witness to such
an affinity for an animal form, that would be one more proof
of the close bonds uniting this conception to the totemic beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>It is possible to explain why this idea has been unable to reach
the same degree of abstraction in Australia as in the more advanced
societies. This is not merely due to the insufficient
aptitude of the Australian for abstracting and generalizing:
before all, it is the nature of the social environment which has
imposed this particularism. In fact, as long as totemism remains
at the basis of the cultural organization, the clan keeps an
autonomy in the religious society which, though not absolute,
is always very marked. Of course we can say that in one sense
each totemic group is only a chapel of the tribal Church;
but it is a chapel enjoying a large independence. The cult celebrated
there, though not a self-sufficing whole, has only external
relations with the others; they interchange without intermingling;
the totem of the clan is fully sacred only for this clan. Consequently
the groups of things attributed to each clan, which are
a part of it in the same way the men are, have the same individuality
and autonomy. Each of them is represented as irreducible
into similar groups, as separated from them by a
break of continuity, and as constituting a distinct realm. Under
these circumstances, it would occur to no one that these heterogeneous
worlds were different manifestations of one and the same
fundamental force; on the contrary, one might suppose that
each of them corresponded to an organically different mana
whose action could not extend beyond the clan and the circle
of things attributed to it. The idea of a single and universal
mana could be born only at the moment when the tribal religion
developed above that of the clans and absorbed them more or
less completely. It is along with the feeling of the tribal unity
that the feeling of the substantial unity of the world awakens.
As we shall presently show,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> it is true that the Australian societies
are already acquainted with a cult that is common to the tribe
as a whole. But if this cult represents the highest form of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Australian religions, it has not succeeded in touching and modifying
the principles upon which they repose: totemism is essentially
a federative religion which cannot go beyond a certain degree of
centralization without ceasing to be itself.</p>

<p>One characteristic fact clearly shows the fundamental reason
which has kept the idea of the mana so specialized in Australia.
The real religious forces, those thought of in the form of totems,
are not the only ones with which the Australian feels himself
obliged to reckon. There are also some over which magicians
have particular control. While the former are theoretically
considered healthful and beneficent, the second have it as their
especial function to cause sickness and death. And at the same
time that they differ so greatly in the nature of their effects,
they are contrasted also by the relations which they sustain
with the social organization. A totem is always a matter of
the clan; but on the contrary, magic is a tribal and even an
intertribal institution. Magic forces do not belong to any
special portion of the tribe in particular. All that is needed to
make use of them is the possession of efficient recipes. Likewise,
everybody is liable to feel their effects and consequently should
try to protect himself against them. These are vague forces,
specially attached to no determined social division, and even
able to spread their action beyond the tribe. Now it is a remarkable
fact that among the Arunta and Loritja, they are conceived
as simple aspects and particular forms of a unique force,
called in Arunta <i>Arungquiltha</i> or <i>Ar&uacute;nkulta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> "This is a term,"
say Spencer and Gillen, "of somewhat vague import, but always
associated at bottom with the possession of <i>supernatural evil
power</i>.... The name is applied indiscriminately to the evil
influence or to the object in which it is, for the time being, or
permanently, resident."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> "By ar&uacute;nkulta," says Strehlow,
"the native signifies a force which suddenly stops life and
brings death to all who come in contact with it."<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> This name
is given to the bones and pieces of wood from which evil-working
charms are derived, and also to poisonous animals and vegetables.
So it may accurately be called a harmful mana. Grey mentions
an absolutely identical notion among the tribes he observed.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
Thus among these different peoples, while the properly religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
forces do not succeed in avoiding a certain heterogeneity, magic
forces are thought of as being all of the same nature; the mind
represents them in their generic unity. This is because they
rise above the social organization and its divisions and subdivisions,
and move in a homogeneous and continuous space
where they meet with nothing to differentiate them. The others,
on the contrary, being localized in definite and distinct social
forms, are diversified and particularized in the image of the
environment in which they are situated.</p>

<p>From this we can see how thoroughly the idea of an impersonal
religious force enters into the meaning and spirit of Australian
totemism, for it disengages itself with clarity as soon as no
contrary cause opposes it. It is true that the arungquiltha is
purely a magic force. But between religious forces and magic
forces there is no difference of kind:<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> sometimes they are even
designated by the same name: in Melanesia, the magicians
and charms have mana just like the agents and rites of the regular
cult;<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> the word oranda is employed in the same way by the
Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> So we can legitimately infer the nature of the one
from that of the other.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The results to which the above analysis has led us do not
concern the history of totemism only, but also the genesis of
religious thought in general.</p>

<p>Under the pretext that in early times men were dominated
by their senses and the representations of their senses, it has
frequently been held that they commenced by representing the
divine in the concrete form of definite and personal beings.
The facts do not confirm this presumption. We have just
described a systematically united scheme of religious beliefs
which we have good reason to regard as very primitive, yet we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
have met with no personalities of this sort. The real totemic
cult is addressed neither to certain determined animals nor to
certain vegetables nor even to an animal or vegetable species,
but to a vague power spread through these things.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> Even in the
most advanced religions which have developed out of totemism,
such as those which we find among the North American Indians,
this idea, instead of being effaced, becomes more conscious of
itself; it is declared with a clarity it did not have before, while
at the same time, it attains a higher generality. It is this which
dominates the entire religious system.</p>

<p>This is the original matter out of which have been constructed
those beings of every sort which the religions of all times have
consecrated and adored. The spirits, demons, genii and gods
of every sort are only the concrete forms taken by this energy,
or "potentiality," as Hewitt calls it,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> in individualizing itself,
in fixing itself upon a certain determined object or point in space,
or in centring around an ideal and legendary being, though one
conceived as real by the popular imagination. A Dakota questioned
by Miss Fletcher expressed this essential consubstantiability
of all sacred things in language that is full of relief. "Every
thing as it moves, now and then, here and there, makes stops.
The bird as it flies stops in one place to make its nest, and in
another to rest in its flight. A man when he goes forth stops
when he wills. So the god has stopped. The sun, which is so
bright and beautiful, is one place where he has stopped. The
trees, the animals, are where he has stopped, and the Indian
thinks of these places and sends his prayers to reach the place
where the god has stopped and to win help and a blessing."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
In other words, the wakan (for this is what he was talking about)
comes and goes through the world, and sacred things are the
points upon which it alights. Here we are, for once, just as far
from naturism as from animism. If the sun, the moon and the
stars have been adored, they have not owed this honour to their
intrinsic nature or their distinctive properties, but to the fact
that they are thought to participate in this force which alone is
able to give things a sacred character, and which is also found
in a multitude of other beings, even the smallest. If the souls of
the dead have been the object of rites, it is not because they are
believed to be made out of some fluid and impalpable substance,
nor is it because they resemble the shadow cast by a body or its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
reflection on a surface of water. Lightness and fluidity are not
enough to confer sanctity; they have been invested with this
dignity only in so far as they contained within them something
of this same force, the source of all religiosity.</p>

<p>We are now in a better condition to understand why it has
been impossible to define religion by the idea of mythical personalities,
gods or spirits; it is because this way of representing
religious things is in no way inherent in their nature. What
we find at the origin and basis of religious thought are not
determined and distinct objects and beings possessing a sacred
character of themselves; they are indefinite powers, anonymous
forces, more or less numerous in different societies, and sometimes
even reduced to a unity, and whose impersonality is strictly
comparable to that of the physical forces whose manifestations
the sciences of nature study. As for particular sacred things,
they are only individualized forms of this essential principle.
So it is not surprising that even in the religions where there are
avowed divinities, there are rites having an efficient virtue in
themselves, independently of all divine intervention. It is
because this force may be attached to words that are pronounced
or movements that are made just as well as to corporal substances;
the voice or the movements may serve as its vehicle, and it may
produce its effects through their intermediacy, without the aid of
any god or spirit. Even should it happen to concentrate itself
especially in a rite, this will become a creator of divinities from
that very fact.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> This is why there is scarcely a divine personality
who does not retain some impersonality. Those who represent
it most clearly in a concrete and visible form, think of it, at the
same time, as an abstract power which cannot be defined except
by its own efficacy, or as a force spread out in space and which is
contained, at least in part, in each of its effects. It is the power
of producing rain or wind, crops or the light of day; Zeus is in
each of the raindrops which falls, just as Ceres is in each of the
sheaves of the harvest.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> As a general rule, in fact, this efficacy
is so imperfectly determined that the believer is able to form
only a very vague notion of it. Moreover, it is this indecision
which has made possible these syncretisms and duplications in
the course of which gods are broken up, dismembered and confused
in every way. Perhaps there is not a single religion in
which the original mana, whether unique or multiform, has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
resolved entirely into a clearly defined number of beings who
are distinct and separate from each other; each of them always
retains a touch of impersonality, as it were, which enables it to
enter into new combinations, not as the result of a simple survival
but because it is the nature of religious forces to be unable to
individualize themselves completely.</p>

<p>This conception, to which we have been led by the study of
totemism alone, has the additional recommendation that many
scholars have recently adopted it quite independently of one
another, as a conclusion from very different sorts of studies.
There is a tendency towards a spontaneous agreement on this
point which should be remarked, for it is a presumption of
objectivity.</p>

<p>As early as 1899, we pointed out the impossibility of making
the idea of a mythical personality enter into the definition of
religious phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> In 1900, Marrett showed the existence
of a religious phase which he called <i>preanimistic</i>, in which the
rites are addressed to impersonal forces like the Melanesian
mana and the wakan of the Omaha and Dakota.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> However,
Marrett did not go so far as to maintain that always and in
every case the idea of a spirit is logically and chronologically
posterior to that of mana and is derived from it; he even seemed
disposed to admit that it has sometimes appeared independently
and consequently, that religious thought flows from a double
source.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> On the other hand, he conceived the mana as an
inherent property of things, as an element of their appearance;
for, according to him, this is simply the character which we
attribute to everything out of the ordinary, and which inspires
a sentiment of fear or admiration.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> This practically amounts to
a return to the naturist theory.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>A little later, MM. Hubert and Mauss, while attempting to
formulate a general theory of magic, established the fact that
magic as a whole reposes on the notion of mana.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The close
kinship of the magic rite and the religious rite being known, it
was even possible to foresee that the same theory should be
applied to religion. This was sustained by Preuss in a series of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
articles in the <i>Globus</i><a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> that same year. Relying chiefly upon
facts taken from American civilizations, Preuss set out to prove
that the ideas of the soul and spirit were not developed until
after those of power and impersonal force, that the former are
only a transformation of the latter, and that up to a relatively
late date they retain the marks of their original impersonality.
In fact, he shows that even in the advanced religions, they are
represented in the form of vague emanations disengaging themselves
automatically from the things in which they reside, and
even tending to escape by all the ways that are open to them:
the mouth, the nose and all the other openings of the body, the
breath, the look, the word, etc. At the same time, Preuss pointed
out their Protean forms and their extreme plasticity which
permits them to give themselves successively and almost concurrently
to the most varied uses.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> It is true that if we stick to
the letter of the terminology employed by this author, we may
believe that for him the forces have a magic, not a religious
nature: he calls them charms (<i>Zauber, Zauberkr&auml;fte</i>). But it is
evident that in expressing himself thus, he does not intend to
put them outside of religion; for it is in the essentially religious
rites that he shows their action, for example, in the great Mexican
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> If he uses these expressions, it is undoubtedly
because he knows no others which mark better the impersonality
of these forces and the sort of mechanism with which they operate.</p>

<p>Thus this same idea tends to come to light on every side.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
The impression becomes more and more prevalent that even
the most elementary mythological constructions are secondary
products<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> which cover over a system of beliefs, at once simpler
and more obscure, vaguer and more essential, which form the
solid foundations upon which the religious systems are built.
It is this primitive foundation which our analysis of totemism
has enabled us to reach. The various writers whose studies we
have just mentioned arrived at this conclusion only through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
facts taken from very diverse religions, some of which even
correspond to a civilization that is already far advanced: such
is the case, for example, with the Mexican religions, of which
Preuss makes great use. So it might be asked if this theory is
equally applicable to the most simple religions. But since it is
impossible to go lower than totemism, we are not exposed to this
risk of error, and at the same time, we have an opportunity of
finding the initial notion from which the ideas of wakan and
mana are derived: this is the notion of the totemic principle.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>But this notion is not only of primary importance because of
the r&ocirc;le it has played in the development of religious ideas; it
also has a lay aspect in which it is of interest for the history of
scientific thought. It is the first form of the idea of force.</p>

<p>In fact, the wakan plays the same r&ocirc;le in the world, as the
Sioux conceives it, as the one played by the forces with which
science explains the diverse phenomena of nature. This, however,
does not mean that it is thought of as an exclusively physical
energy; on the contrary, in the next chapter we shall see that
the elements going to make up this idea are taken from the most
diverse realms. But this very compositeness of its nature enables
it to be utilized as a universal principle of explanation. It is
from it that all life comes;<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> "all life is wakan"; and by this
word life, we must understand everything that acts and reacts,
that moves and is moved, in both the mineral and biological
kingdoms. The wakan is the cause of all the movements which
take place in the universe. We have even seen that the orenda
of the Iroquois is "the efficient cause of all the phenomena
and all the activities which are manifested around men." It is a
power "inherent in all bodies and all things."<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> It is the orenda
which makes the wind blow, the sun lighten and heat the earth,
or animals reproduce and which makes men strong, clever and
intelligent. When the Iroquois says that the life of all nature
is the product of the conflicts aroused between the unequally
intense orenda of the different beings, he only expresses, in his
own language, this modern idea that the world is a system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of forces limiting and containing each other and making an
equilibrium.</p>

<p>The Melanesian attributes this same general efficacy to his
mana. It is owing to his mana that a man succeeds in hunting
or fighting, that gardens give a good return or that flocks prosper.
If an arrow strikes its mark, it is because it is charged with mana;
it is the same cause which makes a net catch fish well, or a canoe
ride well on the sea,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> etc. It is true that if certain phrases of
Codrington are taken literally, mana should be the cause to
which is attributed "everything which is beyond the ordinary
power of men, outside the common processes of nature."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> But
from the very examples which he cites, it is quite evident that
the sphere of the mana is really much more extended. In reality,
it serves to explain usual and everyday phenomena; there is
nothing superhuman or supernatural in the fact that a ship
sails or a hunter catches game, etc. However, among these
events of daily life, there are some so insignificant and familiar
that they pass unperceived: they are not noticed and consequently
no need is felt of explaining them. The concept of mana
is applied only to those that are important enough to cause
reflection, and to awaken a minimum of interest and curiosity;
but they are not marvellous for all that. And what is true of
the mana as well as the orenda and wakan, may be said equally
well of the totemic principle. It is through this that the life of the
men of the clan and the animals or plants of the totemic species,
as well as all the things which are classified under the totem and
partake of its nature, is manifested.</p>

<p>So the idea of force is of religious origin. It is from religion
that it has been borrowed, first by philosophy, then by the
sciences. This has already been foreseen by Comte and this
is why he made metaphysics the heir of "theology." But he
concluded from this that the idea of force is destined to disappear
from science; for, owing to its mystic origins, he refused it all
objective value. But we are going to show that, on the contrary,
religious forces are real, howsoever imperfect the symbols may
be, by the aid of which they are thought of. From this it will
follow that the same is true of the concept of force in general.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER VII</b><br /><br />

<small>ORIGINS OF THESE BELIEFS&mdash;<i>end</i></small><br /><br />

<i>Origin of the Idea of the Totemic Principle or Mana</i></h3>


<p>The proposition established in the preceding chapter
determines the terms in which the problem of the origins
of totemism should be posed. Since totemism is everywhere
dominated by the idea of a quasi-divine principle, imminent
in certain categories of men and things and thought of under
the form of an animal or vegetable, the explanation of this
religion is essentially the explanation of this belief; to arrive at
this, we must seek to learn how men have been led to construct
this idea and out of what materials they have constructed it.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It is obviously not out of the sensations which the things
serving as totems are able to arouse in the mind; we have shown
that these things are frequently insignificant. The lizard, the
caterpillar, the rat, the ant, the frog, the turkey, the bream-fish,
the plum-tree, the cockatoo, etc., to cite only those names which
appear frequently in the lists of Australian totems, are not of a
nature to produce upon men these great and strong impressions
which in a way resemble religious emotions and which impress
a sacred character upon the objects they create. It is true that
this is not the case with the stars and the great atmospheric
phenomena, which have, on the contrary, all that is necessary
to strike the imagination forcibly; but as a matter of fact,
these serve only very exceptionally as totems. It is even probable
that they were very slow in taking this office.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> So it is not the
intrinsic nature of the thing whose name the clan bears that
marked it out to become the object of a cult. Also, if the sentiments
which it inspired were really the determining cause of the
totemic rites and beliefs, it would be the pre-eminently sacred
thing; the animals or plants employed as totems would play
an eminent part in the religious life. But we know that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
centre of the cult is actually elsewhere. It is the figurative
representations of this plant or animal and the totemic emblems
and symbols of every sort, which have the greatest sanctity;
so it is in them that is found the source of that religious nature,
of which the real objects represented by these emblems receive
only a reflection.</p>

<p>Thus the totem is before all a symbol, a material expression of
something else.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> But of what?</p>

<p>From the analysis to which we have been giving our attention,
it is evident that it expresses and symbolizes two different sorts
of things. In the first place, it is the outward and visible form of
what we have called the totemic principle or god. But it is also
the symbol of the determined society called the clan. It is its
flag; it is the sign by which each clan distinguishes itself from
the others, the visible mark of its personality, a mark borne by
everything which is a part of the clan under any title whatsoever,
men, beasts or things. So if it is at once the symbol of the god
and of the society, is that not because the god and the society
are only one? How could the emblem of the group have been
able to become the figure of this quasi-divinity, if the group and
the divinity were two distinct realities? The god of the clan,
the totemic principle, can therefore be nothing else than the
clan itself, personified and represented to the imagination under
the visible form of the animal or vegetable which serves as totem.</p>

<p>But how has this apotheosis been possible, and how did it
happen to take place in this fashion?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>In a general way, it is unquestionable that a society has all
that is necessary to arouse the sensation of the divine in
minds, merely by the power that it has over them; for to its
members it is what a god is to his worshippers. In fact, a god
is, first of all, a being whom men think of as superior to themselves,
and upon whom they feel that they depend. Whether
it be a conscious personality, such as Zeus or Jahveh, or merely
abstract forces such as those in play in totemism, the worshipper,
in the one case as in the other, believes himself held to certain
manners of acting which are imposed upon him by the nature
of the sacred principle with which he feels that he is in communion.
Now society also gives us the sensation of a perpetual
dependence. Since it has a nature which is peculiar to itself
and different from our individual nature, it pursues ends which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
are likewise special to it; but, as it cannot attain them except
through our intermediacy, it imperiously demands our aid. It
requires that, forgetful of our own interests, we make ourselves
its servitors, and it submits us to every sort of inconvenience,
privation and sacrifice, without which social life would be impossible.
It is because of this that at every instant we are obliged
to submit ourselves to rules of conduct and of thought which we
have neither made nor desired, and which are sometimes even
contrary to our most fundamental inclinations and instincts.</p>

<p>Even if society were unable to obtain these concessions and
sacrifices from us except by a material constraint, it might
awaken in us only the idea of a physical force to which we must
give way of necessity, instead of that of a moral power such as
religions adore. But as a matter of fact, the empire which it
holds over consciences is due much less to the physical supremacy
of which it has the privilege than to the moral authority with
which it is invested. If we yield to its orders, it is not merely
because it is strong enough to triumph over our resistance; it is
primarily because it is the object of a venerable respect.</p>

<p>We say that an object, whether individual or collective, inspires
respect when the representation expressing it in the mind is
gifted with such a force that it automatically causes or inhibits
actions, <i>without regard for any consideration relative to their useful
or injurious effects</i>. When we obey somebody because of the
moral authority which we recognize in him, we follow out his
opinions, not because they seem wise, but because a certain
sort of physical energy is imminent in the idea that we form of
this person, which conquers our will and inclines it in the indicated
direction. Respect is the emotion which we experience when we
feel this interior and wholly spiritual pressure operating upon
us. Then we are not determined by the advantages or inconveniences
of the attitude which is prescribed or recommended to
us; it is by the way in which we represent to ourselves the person
recommending or prescribing it. This is why commands generally
take a short, peremptory form leaving no place for hesitation; it
is because, in so far as it is a command and goes by its own force,
it excludes all idea of deliberation or calculation; it gets its
efficacy from the intensity of the mental state in which it is placed.
It is this intensity which creates what is called a moral ascendancy.</p>

<p>Now the ways of action to which society is strongly enough
attached to impose them upon its members, are, by that very
fact, marked with a distinctive sign provocative of respect.
Since they are elaborated in common, the vigour with which
they have been thought of by each particular mind is retained
in all the other minds, and reciprocally. The representations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which express them within each of us have an intensity which
no purely private states of consciousness could ever attain;
for they have the strength of the innumerable individual representations
which have served to form each of them. It is society
who speaks through the mouths of those who affirm them in our
presence; it is society whom we hear in hearing them; and the
voice of all has an accent which that of one alone could never
have.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The very violence with which society reacts, by way of
blame or material suppression, against every attempted dissidence,
contributes to strengthening its empire by manifesting the
common conviction through this burst of ardour.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> In a word,
when something is the object of such a state of opinion, the
representation which each individual has of it gains a power
of action from its origins and the conditions in which it was born,
which even those feel who do not submit themselves to it. It
tends to repel the representations which contradict it, and it
keeps them at a distance; on the other hand, it commands those
acts which will realize it, and it does so, not by a material coercion
or by the perspective of something of this sort, but by the simple
radiation of the mental energy which it contains. It has an
efficacy coming solely from its psychical properties, and it is by
just this sign that moral authority is recognized. So opinion,
primarily a social thing, is a source of authority, and it might
even be asked whether all authority is not the daughter of
opinion.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> It may be objected that science is often the antagonist
of opinion, whose errors it combats and rectifies. But it cannot
succeed in this task if it does not have sufficient authority, and
it can obtain this authority only from opinion itself. If a people
did not have faith in science, all the scientific demonstrations in
the world would be without any influence whatsoever over their
minds. Even to-day, if science happened to resist a very strong
current of public opinion, it would risk losing its credit there.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Since it is in spiritual ways that social pressure exercises
itself, it could not fail to give men the idea that outside themselves
there exist one or several powers, both moral and, at the
same time, efficacious, upon which they depend. They must
think of these powers, at least in part, as outside themselves,
for these address them in a tone of command and sometimes
even order them to do violence to their most natural inclinations.
It is undoubtedly true that if they were able to see that these
influences which they feel emanate from society, then the mythological
system of interpretations would never be born. But
social action follows ways that are too circuitous and obscure,
and employs psychical mechanisms that are too complex to allow
the ordinary observer to see whence it comes. As long as scientific
analysis does not come to teach it to them, men know well that
they are acted upon, but they do not know by whom. So they
must invent by themselves the idea of these powers with which
they feel themselves in connection, and from that, we are able
to catch a glimpse of the way by which they were led to represent
them under forms that are really foreign to their nature and to
transfigure them by thought.</p>


<p class="npara">But a god is not merely an authority upon whom we depend;
it is a force upon which our strength relies. The man who has
obeyed his god and who, for this reason, believes the god is with
him, approaches the world with confidence and with the feeling
of an increased energy. Likewise, social action does not confine
itself to demanding sacrifices, privations and efforts from us. For
the collective force is not entirely outside of us; it does not act
upon us wholly from without; but rather, since society cannot
exist except in and through individual consciousnesses,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> this
force must also penetrate us and organize itself within us; it
thus becomes an integral part of our being and by that very
fact this is elevated and magnified.</p>

<p>There are occasions when this strengthening and vivifying
action of society is especially apparent. In the midst of an
assembly animated by a common passion, we become susceptible
of acts and sentiments of which we are incapable when reduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to our own forces; and when the assembly is dissolved and when,
finding ourselves alone again, we fall back to our ordinary level,
we are then able to measure the height to which we have been
raised above ourselves. History abounds in examples of this
sort. It is enough to think of the night of the Fourth of August,
1789, when an assembly was suddenly led to an act of sacrifice
and abnegation which each of its members had refused the day
before, and at which they were all surprised the day after.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> This
is why all parties, political, economic or confessional, are careful
to have periodical reunions where their members may revivify
their common faith by manifesting it in common. To strengthen
those sentiments which, if left to themselves, would soon weaken,
it is sufficient to bring those who hold them together and to put
them into closer and more active relations with one another.
This is the explanation of the particular attitude of a man speaking
to a crowd, at least if he has succeeded in entering into communion
with it. His language has a grandiloquence that would
be ridiculous in ordinary circumstances; his gestures show a
certain domination; his very thought is impatient of all rules,
and easily falls into all sorts of excesses. It is because he feels
within him an abnormal over-supply of force which overflows
and tries to burst out from him; sometimes he even has the
feeling that he is dominated by a moral force which is greater
than he and of which he is only the interpreter. It is by this trait
that we are able to recognize what has often been called the
demon of oratorical inspiration. Now this exceptional increase
of force is something very real; it comes to him from the very
group which he addresses. The sentiments provoked by his words
come back to him, but enlarged and amplified, and to this degree
they strengthen his own sentiment. The passionate energies
he arouses re-echo within him and quicken his vital tone. It is
no longer a simple individual who speaks; it is a group incarnate
and personified.</p>

<p>Beside these passing and intermittent states, there are other
more durable ones, where this strengthening influence of society
makes itself felt with greater consequences and frequently even
with greater brilliancy. There are periods in history when,
under the influence of some great collective shock, social interactions
have become much more frequent and active. Men look
for each other and assemble together more than ever. That
general effervescence results which is characteristic of revo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>lutionary
or creative epochs. Now this greater activity results
in a general stimulation of individual forces. Men see more and
differently now than in normal times. Changes are not merely
of shades and degrees; men become different. The passions
moving them are of such an intensity that they cannot be satisfied
except by violent and unrestrained actions, actions of superhuman
heroism or of bloody barbarism. This is what explains
the Crusades,<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> for example, or many of the scenes, either sublime
or savage, of the French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Under the influence of
the general exaltation, we see the most mediocre and inoffensive
bourgeois become either a hero or a butcher.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> And so clearly
are all these mental processes the ones that are also at the root
of religion that the individuals themselves have often pictured the
pressure before which they thus gave way in a distinctly religious
form. The Crusaders believed that they felt God present in the
midst of them, enjoining them to go to the conquest of the
Holy Land; Joan of Arc believed that she obeyed celestial
voices.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>But it is not only in exceptional circumstances that this
stimulating action of society makes itself felt; there is not, so
to speak, a moment in our lives when some current of energy
does not come to us from without. The man who has done his
duty finds, in the manifestations of every sort expressing the
sympathy, esteem or affection which his fellows have for him,
a feeling of comfort, of which he does not ordinarily take account,
but which sustains him, none the less. The sentiments which
society has for him raise the sentiments which he has for himself.
Because he is in moral harmony with his comrades, he has more
confidence, courage and boldness in action, just like the believer
who thinks that he feels the regard of his god turned graciously
towards him. It thus produces, as it were, a perpetual sustenance
for our moral nature. Since this varies with a multitude of
external circumstances, as our relations with the groups about
us are more or less active and as these groups themselves vary,
we cannot fail to feel that this moral support depends upon an
external cause; but we do not perceive where this cause is nor
what it is. So we ordinarily think of it under the form of a moral
power which, though immanent in us, represents within us
something not ourselves: this is the moral conscience, of which,
by the way, men have never made even a slightly distinct representation
except by the aid of religious symbols.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to these free forces which are constantly coming
to renew our own, there are others which are fixed in the methods
and traditions which we employ. We speak a language that we
did not make; we use instruments that we did not invent; we
invoke rights that we did not found; a treasury of knowledge
is transmitted to each generation that it did not gather itself,
etc. It is to society that we owe these varied benefits of civilization,
and if we do not ordinarily see the source from which we
get them, we at least know that they are not our own work.
Now it is these things that give man his own place among things;
a man is a man only because he is civilized. So he could not
escape the feeling that outside of him there are active causes
from which he gets the characteristic attributes of his nature
and which, as benevolent powers, assist him, protect him and
assure him of a privileged fate. And of course he must attribute
to these powers a dignity corresponding to the great value of the
good things he attributes to them.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>Thus the environment in which we live seems to us to be
peopled with forces that are at once imperious and helpful,
august and gracious, and with which we have relations. Since
they exercise over us a pressure of which we are conscious, we
are forced to localize them outside ourselves, just as we do for
the objective causes of our sensations. But the sentiments
which they inspire in us differ in nature from those which we
have for simple visible objects. As long as these latter are reduced
to their empirical characteristics as shown in ordinary
experience, and as long as the religious imagination has not
metamorphosed them, we entertain for them no feeling which
resembles respect, and they contain within them nothing that
is able to raise us outside ourselves. Therefore, the representations
which express them appear to us to be very different from those
aroused in us by collective influences. The two form two distinct
and separate mental states in our consciousness, just as do the
two forms of life to which they correspond. Consequently, we
get the impression that we are in relations with two distinct
sorts of reality and that a sharply drawn line of demarcation
separates them from each other: on the one hand is the world
of profane things, on the other, that of sacred things.</p>

<p>Also, in the present day just as much as in the past, we see society
constantly creating sacred things out of ordinary ones. If it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
happens to fall in love with a man and if it thinks it has found
in him the principal aspirations that move it, as well as the means
of satisfying them, this man will be raised above the others and,
as it were, deified. Opinion will invest him with a majesty
exactly analogous to that protecting the gods. This is what
has happened to so many sovereigns in whom their age had
faith: if they were not made gods, they were at least regarded
as direct representatives of the deity. And the fact that it is
society alone which is the author of these varieties of apotheosis,
is evident since it frequently chances to consecrate men thus
who have no right to it from their own merit. The simple
deference inspired by men invested with high social functions
is not different in nature from religious respect. It is expressed
by the same movements: a man keeps at a distance from a
high personage; he approaches him only with precautions;
in conversing with him, he uses other gestures and language
than those used with ordinary mortals. The sentiment felt
on these occasions is so closely related to the religious sentiment
that many peoples have confounded the two. In order to explain
the consideration accorded to princes, nobles and political
chiefs, a sacred character has been attributed to them. In
Melanesia and Polynesia, for example, it is said that an influential
man has <i>mana</i>, and that his influence is due to this
<i>mana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> However, it is evident that his situation is due solely
to the importance attributed to him by public opinion. Thus
the moral power conferred by opinion and that with which sacred
beings are invested are at bottom of a single origin and made up
of the same elements. That is why a single word is able to
designate the two.</p>

<p>In addition to men, society also consecrates things, especially
ideas. If a belief is unanimously shared by a people, then, for
the reason which we pointed out above, it is forbidden to touch
it, that is to say, to deny it or to contest it. Now the prohibition
of criticism is an interdiction like the others and proves the
presence of something sacred. Even to-day, howsoever great
may be the liberty which we accord to others, a man who should
totally deny progress or ridicule the human ideal to which
modern societies are attached, would produce the effect of a
sacrilege. There is at least one principle which those the most
devoted to the free examination of everything tend to place
above discussion and to regard as untouchable, that is to say, as
sacred: this is the very principle of free examination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>This aptitude of society for setting itself up as a god or for
creating gods was never more apparent than during the first
years of the French Revolution. At this time, in fact, under
the influence of the general enthusiasm, things purely la&iuml;cal
by nature were transformed by public opinion into sacred things:
these were the Fatherland, Liberty, Reason.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> A religion tended
to become established which had its dogmas,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> symbols,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> altars<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
and feasts.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> It was to these spontaneous aspirations that the
cult of Reason and the Supreme Being attempted to give a sort
of official satisfaction. It is true that this religious renovation
had only an ephemeral duration. But that was because the
patriotic enthusiasm which at first transported the masses soon
relaxed.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> The cause being gone, the effect could not remain.
But this experiment, though short-lived, keeps all its sociological
interest. It remains true that in one determined case we have
seen society and its essential ideas become, directly and with no
transfiguration of any sort, the object of a veritable cult.</p>

<p>All these facts allow us to catch glimpses of how the clan
was able to awaken within its members the idea that outside
of them there exist forces which dominate them and at the
same time sustain them, that is to say in fine, religious forces:
it is because there is no society with which the primitive is more
directly and closely connected. The bonds uniting him to the
tribe are much more lax and more feebly felt. Although this is
not at all strange or foreign to him, it is with the people of his
own clan that he has the greatest number of things in common;
it is the action of this group that he feels the most directly; so
it is this also which, in preference to all others, should express
itself in religious symbols.</p>

<p>But this first explanation has been too general, for it is applicable
to every sort of society indifferently, and consequently
to every sort of religion. Let us attempt to determine exactly
what form this collective action takes in the clan and how it
arouses the sensation of sacredness there. For there is no place
where it is more easily observable or more apparent in its results.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The life of the Australian societies passes alternately through
two distinct phases.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Sometimes the population is broken up
into little groups who wander about independently of one another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in their various occupations; each family lives by itself, hunting
and fishing, and in a word, trying to procure its indispensable
food by all the means in its power. Sometimes, on the contrary,
the population concentrates and gathers at determined points
for a length of time varying from several days to several months.
This concentration takes place when a clan or a part of the tribe<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
is summoned to the gathering, and on this occasion they celebrate
a religious ceremony, or else hold what is called a corrobbori<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
in the usual ethnological language.</p>

<p>These two phases are contrasted with each other in the sharpest
way. In the first, economic activity is the preponderating one,
and it is generally of a very mediocre intensity. Gathering the
grains or herbs that are necessary for food, or hunting and fishing
are not occupations to awaken very lively passions.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> The dispersed
condition in which the society finds itself results in making
its life uniform, languishing and dull.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> But when a corrobbori
takes place, everything changes. Since the emotional and passional
faculties of the primitive are only imperfectly placed under
the control of his reason and will, he easily loses control of
himself. Any event of some importance puts him quite outside
himself. Does he receive good news? There are at once transports
of enthusiasm. In the contrary conditions, he is to be seen
running here and there like a madman, giving himself up to all
sorts of immoderate movements, crying, shrieking, rolling in
the dust, throwing it in every direction, biting himself, brandishing
his arms in a furious manner, etc.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> The very fact of the
concentration acts as an exceptionally powerful stimulant.
When they are once come together, a sort of electricity is formed
by their collecting which quickly transports them to an extraordinary
degree of exaltation. Every sentiment expressed finds
a place without resistance in all the minds, which are very open
to outside impressions; each re-echoes the others, and is re-echoed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
by the others. The initial impulse thus proceeds, growing as it
goes, as an avalanche grows in its advance. And as such active
passions so free from all control could not fail to burst out, on
every side one sees nothing but violent gestures, cries, veritable
howls, and deafening noises of every sort, which aid in intensifying
still more the state of mind which they manifest. And since a
collective sentiment cannot express itself collectively except on
the condition of observing a certain order permitting co-operation
and movements in unison, these gestures and cries naturally
tend to become rhythmic and regular; hence come songs and
dances. But in taking a more regular form, they lose nothing
of their natural violence; a regulated tumult remains tumult.
The human voice is not sufficient for the task; it is reinforced
by means of artificial processes: boomerangs are beaten against
each other; bull-roarers are whirled. It is probable that these
instruments, the use of which is so general in the Australian
religious ceremonies, are used primarily to express in a more
adequate fashion the agitation felt. But while they express it,
they also strengthen it. This effervescence often reaches such a
point that it causes unheard-of actions. The passions released
are of such an impetuosity that they can be restrained by nothing.
They are so far removed from their ordinary conditions of life,
and they are so thoroughly conscious of it, that they feel that
they must set themselves outside of and above their ordinary
morals. The sexes unite contrarily to the rules governing sexual
relations. Men exchange wives with each other. Sometimes
even incestuous unions, which in normal times are thought
abominable and are severely punished, are now contracted
openly and with impunity.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> If we add to all this that the ceremonies
generally take place at night in a darkness pierced here
and there by the light of fires, we can easily imagine what effect
such scenes ought to produce on the minds of those who participate.
They produce such a violent super-excitation of the
whole physical and mental life that it cannot be supported very
long: the actor taking the principal part finally falls exhausted
on the ground.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>To illustrate and make specific this necessarily schematic
picture, let us describe certain scenes taken from Spencer and
Gillen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most important religious ceremonies among the
Warramunga is the one concerning the snake Wollunqua. It
consists in a series of ceremonies lasting through several days.
On the fourth day comes the following scene.</p>

<p>According to the ceremonial used among the Warramunga,
representatives of the two phratries take part, one as officiants,
the other as preparers and assistants. Only the members of the
Uluuru phratry are qualified to celebrate the rite, but the members
of the Kingilli phratry must decorate the actors, make ready
the place and the instruments, and play the part of an audience.
In this capacity, they were charged with making a sort of mound
in advance out of wet sand, upon which a design is marked
with red down which represents the snake Wollunqua. The
real ceremony only commenced after nightfall. Towards ten or
eleven o'clock, the Uluuru and Kingilli men arrived on the ground,
sat down on the mound and commenced to sing. Everyone was
evidently very excited. A little later in the evening, the Uluuru
brought up their wives and gave them over to the Kingilli,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
who had intercourse with them. Then the recently initiated
young men were brought in and the whole ceremony was explained
to them in detail, and until three o'clock in the morning singing
went on without a pause. Then followed a scene of the wildest
excitement. While fires were lighted on all sides, making the
whiteness of the gum-trees stand out sharply against the surrounding
darkness, the Uluuru knelt down one behind another
beside the mound, then rising from the ground they went around
it, with a movement in unison, their two hands resting upon
their thighs, then a little farther on they knelt down again, and
so on. At the same time they swayed their bodies, now to the
right and now to the left, while uttering at each movement a
piercing cry, a veritable yell, "<i>Yrrsh! Yrrsh! Yrrsh!</i>" In
the meantime the Kingilli, in a state of great excitement, clanged
their boomerangs and their chief was even more agitated than
his companions. When the procession of the Uluuru had twice
gone around the mound, quitting the kneeling position, they
sat down and commenced to sing again; at moments the singing
died away, then suddenly took up again. When day commenced
to dawn, all leaped to their feet; the fires that had gone out
were relighted and the Uluuru, urged on by the Kingilli, attacked
the mound furiously with boomerangs, lances and clubs; in a
few minutes it was torn to pieces. The fires died away and profound
silence reigned again.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>A still more violent scene at which these same observers
assisted was in connection with the fire ceremonies among the
Warramunga.</p>

<p>Commencing at nightfall, all sorts of processions, dances and
songs had taken place by torchlight; the general effervescence
was constantly increasing. At a given moment, twelve assistants
each took a great lighted torch in their hands, and one of them
holding his like a bayonet, charged into a group of natives.
Blows were warded off with clubs and spears. A general m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
followed. The men leaped and pranced about, uttering savage
yells all the time; the burning torches continually came crashing
down on the heads and bodies of the men, scattering lighted
sparks in every direction. "The smoke, the blazing torches,
the showers of sparks falling in all directions and the masses
of dancing, yelling men," say Spencer and Gillen, "formed
altogether a genuinely wild and savage scene of which it is impossible
to convey any adequate idea in words."<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>One can readily conceive how, when arrived at this state of
exaltation, a man does not recognize himself any longer. Feeling
himself dominated and carried away by some sort of an external
power which makes him think and act differently than in normal
times, he naturally has the impression of being himself no longer.
It seems to him that he has become a new being: the decorations
he puts on and the masks that cover his face figure materially
in this interior transformation, and to a still greater extent,
they aid in determining its nature. And as at the same time all
his companions feel themselves transformed in the same way
and express this sentiment by their cries, their gestures and their
general attitude, everything is just as though he really were
transported into a special world, entirely different from the
one where he ordinarily lives, and into an environment filled
with exceptionally intense forces that take hold of him and
metamorphose him. How could such experiences as these,
especially when they are repeated every day. for weeks, fail to
leave in him the conviction that there really exist two heterogeneous
and mutually incomparable worlds? One is that where
his daily life drags wearily along; but he cannot penetrate into
the other without at once entering into relations with extraordinary
powers that excite him to the point of frenzy. The first
is the profane world, the second, that of sacred things.</p>

<p>So it is in the midst of these effervescent social environments
and out of this effervescence itself that the religious idea seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to be born. The theory that this is really its origin is confirmed
by the fact that in Australia the really religious activity is almost
entirely confined to the moments when these assemblies are
held. To be sure, there is no people among whom the great
solemnities of the cult are not more or less periodic; but in the
more advanced societies, there is not, so to speak, a day when
some prayer or offering is not addressed to the gods and some
ritual act is not performed. But in Australia, on the contrary,
apart from the celebrations of the clan and tribe, the time is
nearly all filled with lay and profane occupations. Of course
there are prohibitions that should be and are preserved even
during these periods of temporal activity; it is never permissible
to kill or eat freely of the totemic animal, at least in those parts
where the interdiction has retained its original vigour; but
almost no positive rites are then celebrated, and there are no
ceremonies of any importance. These take place only in the
midst of assembled groups. The religious life of the Australian
passes through successive phases of complete lull and of super-excitation,
and social life oscillates in the same rhythm. This
puts clearly into evidence the bond uniting them to one another,
but among the peoples called civilized, the relative continuity
of the two blurs their relations. It might even be asked whether
the violence of this contrast was not necessary to disengage the
feeling of sacredness in its first form. By concentrating itself
almost entirely in certain determined moments, the collective
life has been able to attain its greatest intensity and efficacy,
and consequently to give men a more active sentiment of the
double existence they lead and of the double nature in which
they participate.</p>


<p class="npara">But this explanation is still incomplete. We have shown
how the clan, by the manner in which it acts upon its members,
awakens within them the idea of external forces which dominate
them and exalt them; but we must still demand how it happens
that these forces are thought of under the form of totems, that
is to say, in the shape of an animal or plant.</p>

<p>It is because this animal or plant has given its name to the
clan and serves it as emblem. In fact, it is a well-known law
that the sentiments aroused in us by something spontaneously
attach themselves to the symbol which represents them. For
us, black is a sign of mourning; it also suggests sad impressions
and ideas. This transference of sentiments comes simply from
the fact that the idea of a thing and the idea of its symbol are
closely united in our minds; the result is that the emotions provoked
by the one extend contagiously to the other. But this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
contagion, which takes place in every case to a certain degree,
is much more complete and more marked when the symbol is
something simple, definite and easily representable, while the
thing itself, owing to its dimensions, the number of its parts and
the complexity of their arrangement, is difficult to hold in the
mind. For we are unable to consider an abstract entity, which
we can represent only laboriously and confusedly, the source
of the strong sentiments which we feel. We cannot explain
them to ourselves except by connecting them to some concrete
object of whose reality we are vividly aware. Then if the thing
itself does not fulfil this condition, it cannot serve as the accepted
basis of the sentiments felt, even though it may be what really
aroused them. Then some sign takes its place; it is to this that
we connect the emotions it excites. It is this which is loved,
feared, respected; it is to this that we are grateful; it is for
this that we sacrifice ourselves. The soldier who dies for his flag,
dies for his country; but as a matter of fact, in his own consciousness,
it is the flag that has the first place. It sometimes
happens that this even directly determines action. Whether
one isolated standard remains in the hands of the enemy or not
does not determine the fate of the country, yet the soldier allows
himself to be killed to regain it. He loses sight of the fact that
the flag is only a sign, and that it has no value in itself, but only
brings to mind the reality that it represents; it is treated as if
it were this reality itself.</p>

<p>Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural
that the impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds&mdash;impressions
of dependence and of increased vitality&mdash;should
fix themselves to the idea of the totem rather than that of the
clan: for the clan is too complex a reality to be represented
clearly in all its complex unity by such rudimentary intelligences.
More than that, the primitive does not even see that these
impressions come to him from the group. He does not know
that the coming together of a number of men associated in the
same life results in disengaging new energies, which transform
each of them. All that he knows is that he is raised above
himself and that he sees a different life from the one he ordinarily
leads. However, he must connect these sensations to some
external object as their cause. Now what does he see about
him? On every side those things which appeal to his senses
and strike his imagination are the numerous images of the totem.
They are the waninga and the nurtunja, which are symbols of
the sacred being. They are churinga and bull-roarers, upon which
are generally carved combinations of lines having the same
significance. They are the decorations covering the different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
parts of his body, which are totemic marks. How could this
image, repeated everywhere and in all sorts of forms, fail to
stand out with exceptional relief in his mind? Placed thus
in the centre of the scene, it becomes representative. The sentiments
experienced fix themselves upon it, for it is the only
concrete object upon which they can fix themselves. It continues
to bring them to mind and to evoke them even after the assembly
has dissolved, for it survives the assembly, being carved upon the
instruments of the cult, upon the sides of rocks, upon bucklers,
etc. By it, the emotions experienced are perpetually sustained
and revived. Everything happens just as if they inspired them
directly. It is still more natural to attribute them to it for,
since they are common to the group, they can be associated only
with something that is equally common to all. Now the totemic
emblem is the only thing satisfying this condition. By definition,
it is common to all. During the ceremony, it is the centre of all
regards. While generations change, it remains the same; it is
the permanent element of the social life. So it is from it that
those mysterious forces seem to emanate with which men feel
that they are related, and thus they have been led to represent
these forces under the form of the animate or inanimate being
whose name the clan bears.</p>

<p>When this point is once established, we are in a position to
understand all that is essential in the totemic beliefs.</p>

<p>Since religious force is nothing other than the collective and
anonymous force of the clan, and since this can be represented
in the mind only in the form of the totem, the totemic emblem
is like the visible body of the god. Therefore, it is from it that
those kindly or dreadful actions seem to emanate, which the
cult seeks to provoke or prevent; consequently, it is to it that
the cult is addressed. This is the explanation of why it holds
the first place in the series of sacred things.</p>

<p>But the clan, like every other sort of society, can live only in
and through the individual consciousnesses that compose it.
So if religious force, in so far as it is conceived as incorporated
in the totemic emblem, appears to be outside of the individuals
and to be endowed with a sort of transcendence over them,
it, like the clan of which it is the symbol, can be realized only in
and through them; in this sense, it is imminent in them and
they necessarily represent it as such. They feel it present and
active within them, for, it is this which raises them to a superior
life. This is why men have believed that they contain within
them a principle comparable to the one residing in the totem,
and consequently, why they have attributed a sacred character to
themselves, but one less marked than that of the emblem. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
because the emblem is the pre-eminent source of the religious
life; the man participates in it only indirectly, as he is well
aware; he takes into account the fact that the force that transports
him into the world of sacred things is not inherent in him,
but comes to him from the outside.</p>

<p>But for still another reason, the animals or vegetables of the
totemic species should have the same character, and even to a
higher degree. If the totemic principle is nothing else than the
clan, it is the clan thought of under the material form of the
totemic emblem; now this form is also that of the concrete
beings whose name the clan bears. Owing to this resemblance,
they could not fail to evoke sentiments analogous to those aroused
by the emblem itself. Since the latter is the object of a religious
respect, they too should inspire respect of the same sort and
appear to be sacred. Having external forms so nearly identical,
it would be impossible for the native not to attribute to them
forces of the same nature. It is therefore forbidden to kill or
eat the totemic animal, since its flesh is believed to have the
positive virtues resulting from the rites; it is because it resembles
the emblem of the clan, that is to say, it is in its own image.
And since the animal naturally resembles the emblem more
than the man does, it is placed on a superior rank in the hierarchy
of sacred things. Between these two beings there is undoubtedly
a close relationship, for they both partake of the same essence:
both incarnate something of the totemic principle. However,
since the principle itself is conceived under an animal form, the
animal seems to incarnate it more fully than the man. Therefore,
if men consider it and treat it as a brother, it is at least
as an elder brother.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>But even if the totemic principle has its preferred seat in a
determined species of animal or vegetable, it cannot remain
localized there. A sacred character is to a high degree contagious;<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
it therefore spreads out from the totemic being to everything that
is closely or remotely connected with it. The religious sentiments
inspired by the animal are communicated to the substances
upon which it is nourished and which serve to make or remake
its flesh and blood, to the things that resemble it, and to the
different beings with which it has constant relations. Thus,
little by little, sub-totems are attached to the totems and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the cosmological systems expressed by the primitive classifications.
At last, the whole world is divided up among the totemic
principles of each tribe.</p>

<p>We are now able to explain the origin of the ambiguity of
religious forces as they appear in history, and how they are
physical as well as human, moral as well as material. They are
moral powers because they are made up entirely of the impressions
this moral being, the group, arouses in those other moral beings,
its individual members; they do not translate the manner in
which physical things affect our senses, but the way in which
the collective consciousness acts upon individual consciousnesses.
Their authority is only one form of the moral ascendancy of
society over its members. But, on the other hand, since they
are conceived of under material forms, they could not fail to be
regarded as closely related to material things.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> Therefore they
dominate the two worlds. Their residence is in men, but at the
same time they are the vital principles of things. They animate
minds and discipline them, but it is also they who make plants
grow and animals reproduce. It is this double nature which
has enabled religion to be like the womb from which come all
the leading germs of human civilization. Since it has been made
to embrace all of reality, the physical world as well as the moral
one, the forces that move bodies as well as those that move
minds have been conceived in a religious form. That is how
the most diverse methods and practices, both those that make
possible the continuation of the moral life (law, morals, beaux-arts)
and those serving the material life (the natural, technical
and practical sciences), are either directly or indirectly derived
from religion.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The first religious conceptions have often been attributed
to feelings of weakness and dependence, of fear and anguish
which seized men when they came into contact with the world.
Being the victims of nightmares of which they were themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the creators, they believed themselves surrounded by hostile
and redoubtable powers which their rites sought to appease.
We have now shown that the first religions were of a wholly
different origin. The famous formula <i>Primus in orbe deos fecit
timor</i> is in no way justified by the facts. The primitive does not
regard his gods as foreigners, enemies or thoroughly and necessarily
malevolent beings whose favours he must acquire at any
price; quite on the contrary, they are rather friends, kindred or
natural protectors for him. Are these not the names he gives to
the beings of the totemic species? The power to which the cult
is addressed is not represented as soaring high above him and
overwhelming him by its superiority; on the contrary, it is
very near to him and confers upon him very useful powers which
he could never acquire by himself. Perhaps the deity has never
been nearer to men than at this period of history, when it is
present in the things filling their immediate environment and is,
in part, imminent in himself. In fine, the sentiments at the root
of totemism are those of happy confidence rather than of terror
and compression. If we set aside the funeral rites&mdash;the sober
side of every religion&mdash;we find the totemic cult celebrated in
the midst of songs, dances and dramatic representations. As we
shall see, cruel expiations are relatively rare; even the painful
and obligatory mutilations of the initiations are not of this
character. The terrible and jealous gods appear but slowly in
the religious evolution. This is because primitive societies are
not those huge Leviathans which overwhelm a man by the
enormity of their power and place him under a severe discipline;<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
he gives himself up to them spontaneously and without resistance.
As the social soul is then made up of only a small number of
ideas and sentiments, it easily becomes wholly incarnate in each
individual consciousness. The individual carries it all inside of
him; it is a part of him and consequently, when he gives himself
up to the impulses inspired by it, he does not feel that he is giving
way before compulsion, but that he is going where his nature calls
him.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>This way of understanding the origins of religious thought
escapes the objections raised against the most accredited classical
theories.</p>

<p>We have seen how the naturists and animists pretend to construct
the idea of sacred beings out of the sensations evoked in
us by different phenomena of the physical or biological order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and we have shown how this enterprise is impossible and even
self-contradictory. Nothing is worth nothing. The impressions
produced in us by the physical world can, by definition, contain
nothing that surpasses this world. Out of the visible, only the
visible can be made; out of that which is heard, we cannot
make something not heard. Then to explain how the idea of
sacredness has been able to take form under these conditions,
the majority of the theorists have been obliged to admit that
men have superimposed upon reality, such as it is given by
observation, an unreal world, constructed entirely out of the
fantastic images which agitate his mind during a dream, or else
out of the frequently monstrous aberrations produced by the
mythological imagination under the bewitching but deceiving
influence of language. But it remained incomprehensible that
humanity should have remained obstinate in these errors through
the ages, for experience should have very quickly proven them
false.</p>

<p>But from our point of view, these difficulties disappear.
Religion ceases to be an inexplicable hallucination and takes a
foothold in reality. In fact, we can say that the believer is not
deceived when he believes in the existence of a moral power
upon which he depends and from which he receives all that
is best in himself: this power exists, it is society. When the
Australian is carried outside himself and feels a new life flowing
within him whose intensity surprises him, he is not the dupe of
an illusion; this exaltation is real and is really the effect of forces
outside of and superior to the individual. It is true that he is
wrong in thinking that this increase of vitality is the work of a
power in the form of some animal or plant. But this error is
merely in regard to the letter of the symbol by which this being
is represented to the mind and the external appearance which
the imagination has given it, and not in regard to the fact of its
existence. Behind these figures and metaphors, be they gross or
refined, there is a concrete and living reality. Thus religion
acquires a meaning and a reasonableness that the most intransigent
rationalist cannot misunderstand. Its primary object is not to
give men a representation of the physical world; for if that were
its essential task, we could not understand how it has been able
to survive, for, on this side, it is scarcely more than a fabric of
errors. Before all, it is a system of ideas with which the individuals
represent to themselves the society of which they are members,
and the obscure but intimate relations which they have with it.
This is its primary function; and though metaphorical and
symbolic, this representation is not unfaithful. Quite on the
contrary, it translates everything essential in the relations which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
are to be explained: for it is an eternal truth that outside of us
there exists something greater than us, with which we enter into
communion.</p>

<p>That is why we can rest assured in advance that the practices
of the cult, whatever they may be, are something more than
movements without importance and gestures without efficacy.
By the mere fact that their apparent function is to strengthen
the bonds attaching the believer to his god, they at the same
time really strengthen the bonds attaching the individual to
the society of which he is a member, since the god is only a
figurative expression of the society. We are even able to understand
how the fundamental truth thus contained in religion has
been able to compensate for the secondary errors which it almost
necessarily implies, and how believers have consequently been
restrained from tearing themselves off from it, in spite of the
misunderstandings which must result from these errors. It is
undeniably true that the recipes which it recommends that men
use to act upon things are generally found to be ineffective.
But these checks can have no profound influence, for they do
not touch religion in its fundamentals.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>However, it may be objected that even according to this
hypothesis, religion remains the object of a certain delirium.
What other name can we give to that state when, after a collective
effervescence, men believe themselves transported into an entirely
different world from the one they have before their eyes?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that religious life cannot attain a certain
degree of intensity without implying a psychical exaltation not
far removed from delirium. That is why the prophets, the
founders of religions, the great saints, in a word, the men whose
religious consciousness is exceptionally sensitive, very frequently
give signs of an excessive nervousness that is even pathological:
these physiological defects predestined them to great religious
r&ocirc;les. The ritual use of intoxicating liquors is to be explained
in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Of course this does not mean that an ardent
religious faith is necessarily the fruit of the drunkenness and
mental derangement which accompany it; but as experience
soon informed people of the similarities between the mentality
of a delirious person and that of a seer, they sought to open a
way to the second by artificially exciting the first. But if, for
this reason, it may be said that religion is not without a certain
delirium, it must be added that this delirium, if it has the causes
which we have attributed to it, <i>is well-founded</i>. The images out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of which it is made are not pure illusions like those the naturists
and animists put at the basis of religion; they correspond to
something in reality. Of course it is only natural that the moral
forces they express should be unable to affect the human mind
powerfully without pulling it outside itself and without plunging
it into a state that may be called <i>ecstatic</i>, provided that the word
be taken in its etymological sense (&#7956;&#954;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;); but it does not
follow that they are imaginary. Quite on the contrary, the mental
agitation they cause bears witness to their reality. It is merely
one more proof that a very intense social life always does a sort
of violence to the organism, as well as to the individual consciousness,
which interferes with its normal functioning. Therefore it
can last only a limited length of time.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, if we give the name delirious to every state in which
the mind adds to the immediate data given by the senses and
projects its own sentiments and feelings into things, then nearly
every collective representation is in a sense delirious; religious
beliefs are only one particular case of a very general law. Our
whole social environment seems to us to be filled with forces
which really exist only in our own minds. We know what the
flag is for the soldier; in itself, it is only a piece of cloth. Human
blood is only an organic liquid, but even to-day we cannot see it
flowing without feeling a violent emotion which its physico-chemical
properties cannot explain. From the physical point of
view, a man is nothing more than a system of cells, or from the
mental point of view, than a system of representations; in
either case, he differs only in degree from animals. Yet society
conceives him, and obliges us to conceive him, as invested with
a character <i>sui generis</i> that isolates him, holds at a distance
all rash encroachments and, in a word, imposes respect. This
dignity which puts him into a class by himself appears to us as
one of his distinctive attributes, although we can find nothing
in the empirical nature of man which justifies it. A cancelled
postage stamp may be worth a fortune; but surely this value
is in no way implied in its natural properties. In a sense, our
representation of the external world is undoubtedly a mere
fabric of hallucinations, for the odours, tastes and colours that
we put into bodies are not really there, or at least, they are
not such as we perceive them. However, our olfactory, gustatory
and visual sensations continue to correspond to certain objective
states of the things represented; they express in their way
the properties, either of material particles or of ether waves,
which certainly have their origin in the bodies which we perceive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
as fragrant, sapid or coloured. But collective representations very
frequently attribute to the things to which they are attached qualities
which do not exist under any form or to any degree. Out of the
commonest object, they can make a most powerful sacred being.</p>

<p>Yet the powers which are thus conferred, though purely
ideal, act as though they were real; they determine the conduct
of men with the same degree of necessity as physical forces.
The Arunta who has been rubbed with his churinga feels himself
stronger; he is stronger. If he has eaten the flesh of an animal
which, though perfectly healthy, is forbidden to him, he will
feel himself sick, and may die of it. Surely the soldier who falls
while defending his flag does not believe that he sacrifices himself
for a bit of cloth. This is all because social thought, owing to the
imperative authority that is in it, has an efficacy that individual
thought could never have; by the power which it has over our
minds, it can make us see things in whatever light it pleases;
it adds to reality or deducts from it according to the circumstances.
Thus there is one division of nature where the formula
of idealism is applicable almost to the letter: this is the social
kingdom. Here more than anywhere else, the idea is the reality.
Even in this case, of course, idealism is not true without modification.
We can never escape the duality of our nature and free
ourselves completely from physical necessities: in order to express
our own ideas to ourselves, it is necessary, as has been shown
above, that we fix them upon material things which symbolize
them. But here the part of matter is reduced to a minimum.
The object serving as support for the idea is not much in
comparison with the ideal superstructure, beneath which it
disappears, and also, it counts for nothing in the superstructure.
This is what that pseudo-delirium consists in, which we find at
the bottom of so many collective representations: it is only a
form of this essential idealism.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> So it is not properly called a
delirium, for the ideas thus objectified are well founded, not in
the nature of the material things upon which they settle themselves,
but in the nature of society.</p>

<p>We are now able to understand how the totemic principle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and in general, every religious force, comes to be outside of the
object in which it resides.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> It is because the idea of it is in no
way made up of the impressions directly produced by this thing
upon our senses or minds. Religious force is only the sentiment
inspired by the group in its members, but projected outside of
the consciousnesses that experience them, and objectified. To
be objectified, they are fixed upon some object which thus becomes
sacred; but any object might fulfil this function. In principle,
there are none whose nature predestines them to it to the exclusion
of all others; but also there are none that are necessarily
impossible.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Everything depends upon the circumstances which
lead the sentiment creating religious ideas to establish itself
here or there, upon this point or upon that one. Therefore, the
sacred character assumed by an object is not implied in the
intrinsic properties of this latter: <i>it is added to them</i>. The world
of religious things is not one particular aspect of empirical nature;
<i>it is superimposed upon it</i>.</p>

<p>This conception of the religious, finally, allows us to explain
an important principle found at the bottom of a multitude of
myths and rites, and which may be stated thus: when a sacred
thing is subdivided, each of its parts remains equal to the thing
itself. In other words, as far as religious thought is concerned,
the part is equal to the whole; it has the same powers, the same
efficacy. The debris of a relic has the same virtue as a relic in
good condition. The smallest drop of blood contains the same
active principle as the whole thing. The soul, as we shall see,
may be broken up into nearly as many pieces as there are organs
or tissues in the organism; each of these partial souls is worth
a whole soul. This conception would be inexplicable if the
sacredness of something were due to the constituent properties
of the thing itself; for in that case, it should vary with this thing,
increasing and decreasing with it. But if the virtues it is believed
to possess are not intrinsic in it, and if they come from certain
sentiments which it brings to mind and symbolizes, though these
originate outside of it, then, since it has no need of determined
dimensions to play this r&ocirc;le of reminder, it will have the same
value whether it is entire or not. Since the part makes us think
of the whole, it evokes the same sentiments as the whole. A mere
fragment of the flag represents the fatherland just as well as the
flag itself: so it is sacred in the same way and to the same degree.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>But if this theory of totemism has enabled us to explain
the most characteristic beliefs of this religion, it rests upon a
fact not yet explained. When the idea of the totem, the emblem
of the clan, is given, all the rest follows; but we must still investigate
how this idea has been formed. This is a double question
and may be subdivided as follows: What has led the clan to
choose an emblem? and why have these emblems been borrowed
from the animal and vegetable worlds, and particularly from the
former?</p>

<p>That an emblem is useful as a rallying-centre for any sort of
a group it is superfluous to point out. By expressing the social
unity in a material form, it makes this more obvious to all, and
for that very reason the use of emblematic symbols must have
spread quickly when once thought of. But more than that,
this idea should spontaneously arise out of the conditions of
common life; for the emblem is not merely a convenient process
for clarifying the sentiment society has of itself: it also serves to
create this sentiment; it is one of its constituent elements.</p>

<p>In fact, if left to themselves, individual consciousnesses are
closed to each other; they can communicate only by means of
signs which express their internal states. If the communication
established between them is to become a real communion, that
is to say, a fusion of all particular sentiments into one common
sentiment, the signs expressing them must themselves be fused
into one single and unique resultant. It is the appearance of
this that informs individuals that they are in harmony and makes
them conscious of their moral unity. It is by uttering the same
cry, pronouncing the same word, or performing the same gesture
in regard to some object that they become and feel themselves
to be in unison. It is true that individual representations also
cause reactions in the organism that are not without importance;
however, they can be thought of apart from these physical
reactions which accompany them or follow them, but which do
not constitute them. But it is quite another matter with collective
representations. They presuppose that minds act and react
upon one another; they are the product of these actions and
reactions which are themselves possible only through material
intermediaries. These latter do not confine themselves to revealing
the mental state with which they are associated; they aid in
creating it. Individual minds cannot come in contact and communicate
with each other except by coming out of themselves;
but they cannot do this except by movements. So it is the homogeneity
of these movements that gives the group consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of itself and consequently makes it exist. When this homogeneity
is once established and these movements have once taken
a stereotyped form, they serve to symbolize the corresponding
representations. But they symbolize them only because they
have aided in forming them.</p>

<p>Moreover, without symbols, social sentiments could have only
a precarious existence. Though very strong as long as men are
together and influence each other reciprocally, they exist only
in the form of recollections after the assembly has ended, and
when left to themselves, these become feebler and feebler; for
since the group is now no longer present and active, individual
temperaments easily regain the upper hand. The violent passions
which may have been released in the heart of a crowd fall away
and are extinguished when this is dissolved, and men ask themselves
with astonishment how they could ever have been so
carried away from their normal character. But if the movements
by which these sentiments are expressed are connected with
something that endures, the sentiments themselves become more
durable. These other things are constantly bringing them to
mind and arousing them; it is as though the cause which excited
them in the first place continued to act. Thus these systems
of emblems, which are necessary if society is to become conscious
of itself, are no less indispensable for assuring the continuation
of this consciousness.</p>

<p>So we must refrain from regarding these symbols as simple
artifices, as sorts of labels attached to representations already
made, in order to make them more manageable: they are an
integral part of them. Even the fact that collective sentiments
are thus attached to things completely foreign to them is not
purely conventional: it illustrates under a conventional form
a real characteristic of social facts, that is, their transcendence
over individual minds. In fact, it is known that social phenomena
are born, not in individuals, but in the group. Whatever part we
may take in their origin, each of us receives them from without.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
So when we represent them to ourselves as emanating from a
material object, we do not completely misunderstand their
nature. Of course they do not come from the specific thing
to which we connect them, but nevertheless, it is true that their
origin is outside of us. If the moral force sustaining the believer
does not come from the idol he adores or the emblem he venerates,
still it is from outside of him, as he is well aware. The objectivity
of its symbol only translates its externalness.</p>

<p>Thus social life, in all its aspects and in every period of its
history, is made possible only by a vast symbolism. The material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
emblems and figurative representations with which we are more
especially concerned in our present study, are one form of this;
but there are many others. Collective sentiments can just
as well become incarnate in persons or formul&aelig;: some formul&aelig;
are flags, while there are persons, either real or mythical, who
are symbols. But there is one sort of emblem which should
make an early appearance without reflection or calculation:
this is tattooing. Indeed, well-known facts demonstrate that it
is produced almost automatically in certain conditions. When
men of an inferior culture are associated in a common life, they
are frequently led, by an instinctive tendency, as it were, to
paint or cut upon the body, images that bear witness to their
common existence. According to a text of Procopius, the early
Christians printed on their skin the name of Christ or the sign
of the cross;<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> for a long time, the groups of pilgrims going to
Palestine were also tattooed on the arm or wrist with designs
representing the cross or the monogram of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> This same
usage is also reported among the pilgrims going to certain holy
places in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> A curious case of spontaneous tattooing is
given by Lombroso: twenty young men in an Italian college,
when on the point of separating, decorated themselves with
tattoos recording, in various ways, the years they had spent
together.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The same fact has frequently been observed among
the soldiers in the same barracks, the sailors in the same boat,
or the prisoners in the same jail.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> It will be understood that
especially where methods are still rudimentary, tattooing should
be the most direct and expressive means by which the communion
of minds can be affirmed. The best way of proving to one's
self and to others that one is a member of a certain group is to
place a distinctive mark on the body. The proof that this is the
reason for the existence of the totemic image is the fact, which
we have already mentioned, that it does not seek to reproduce
the aspect of the thing it is supposed to represent. It is made
up of lines and points to which a wholly conventional significance
is attributed.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Its object is not to represent or bring to mind
a determined object, but to bear witness to the fact that a certain
number of individuals participate in the same moral life.</p>

<p>Moreover, the clan is a society which is less able than any
other to do without an emblem or symbol, for there is almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>no other so lacking in consistency. The clan cannot be defined
by its chief, for if central authority is not lacking, it is at least
uncertain and unstable.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Nor can it be defined by the territory
it occupies, for the population, being nomad,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> is not closely
attached to any special locality. Also, owing to the exogamic
law, husband and wife must be of different totems; so wherever
the totem is transmitted in the maternal line&mdash;and this system
of filiation is still the most general one<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>&mdash;the children are of a
different clan from their father, though living near to him.
Therefore we find representatives of a number of different
clans in each family, and still more in each locality. The unity
of the group is visible, therefore, only in the collective name
borne by all the members, and in the equally collective emblem
reproducing the object designated by this name. A clan is
essentially a reunion of individuals who bear the same name
and rally around the same sign. Take away the name and the
sign which materializes it, and the clan is no longer representable.
Since the group is possible only on this condition, both the
institution of the emblem and the part it takes in the life of the
group are thus explained.</p>


<p class="npara">It remains to ask why these names and emblems were taken
almost exclusively from the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
but especially from the former.</p>

<p>It seems probable to us that the emblem has played a more
important part than the name. In any case, the written sign
still holds a more central place in the life of the clan to-day
than does the spoken sign. Now the basis of an emblematic
image can be found only in something susceptible of being
represented by a design. On the other hand, these things had
to be those with which the men of the clan were the most immediately
and habitually coming in contact. Animals fulfilled
this condition to a pre-eminent degree. For these nations of
hunters and fishers, the animal constituted an essential element
of the economic environment. In this connection plants had
only a secondary place for they can hold only a secondary place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
as food as long as they are not cultivated. Moreover, the animal
is more closely associated with the life of men than the plant is,
if only because of the natural kinship uniting these two to each
other. On the other hand, the sun, moon and stars are too far
away, they give the effect of belonging to another world.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Also,
as long as the constellations were not distinguished and classified,
the starry vault did not offer a sufficient diversity of clearly
differentiated things to be able to mark all the clans and sub-clans
of a tribe; but, on the contrary, the variety of the flora,
and especially of the fauna, was almost inexhaustible. Therefore
celestial bodies, in spite of their brilliancy and the sharp impression
they make upon the senses, were unfitted for the r&ocirc;le of totems,
while animals and plants seemed predestined to it.</p>

<p>Ah observation of Strehlow even allows us to state precisely
the way in which these emblems were probably chosen. He says
that he has noticed that the totemic centres are generally situated
near a mountain, spring or gorge where the animals serving as
totems to the group gather in abundance, and he cites a certain
number of examples of this fact.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Now these totemic centres
are surely the consecrated places where the meetings of the clan
are held. So it seems as though each group had taken as its
insignia the animal or plant that was the commonest in the
vicinity of the place where it had the habit of meeting.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>This conception of totemism will give us the explanation
of a very curious trait of human mentality which, even though
more marked formerly than to-day, has not yet disappeared and
which, in any case, has been of considerable importance in the
history of human thought. It will furnish still another occasion
for showing how logical evolution is closely connected with
religious evolution and how it, like this latter, depends upon
social conditions.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is one truth which appears to be absolutely certain
to-day, it is that beings differing not only in their outward appearance
but also in their most essential properties, such as minerals,
plants, animals and men, cannot be considered equivalent and
interchangeable. Long usage, which scientific culture has still
more firmly embedded in our minds, has taught us to establish
barriers between the kingdoms, whose existence transformism
itself does not deny; for though this admits that life may have
arisen from non-living matter and men from animals, still, it
does not fail to recognize the fact that living beings, once formed,
are different from minerals, and men different from animals.
Within each kingdom the same barriers separate the different
classes: we cannot conceive of one mineral having the same
distinctive characteristics as another, or of one animal species
having those of another species. But these distinctions, which
seem so natural to us, are in no way primitive. In the beginning,
all the kingdoms are confounded with each other. Rocks have
a sex; they have the power of begetting; the sun, moon and
stars are men or women who feel and express human sentiments,
while men, on the contrary, are thought of as animals or
plants. This state of confusion is found at the basis of all
mythologies. Hence comes the ambiguous character of the beings
portrayed in the mythologies; they can be classified in no
definite group, for they participate at the same time in the
most opposed groups. It is also readily admitted that they
can go from one into another; and for a long time men believed
that they were able to explain the origin of things by these
transmutations.</p>

<p>That the anthropomorphic instinct, with which the animists
have endowed primitive men, cannot explain their mental
condition is shown by the nature of the confusions of which they
are guilty. In fact, these do not come from the fact that men
have immoderately extended the human kingdom to the point
of making all the others enter into it, but from the fact that they
confound the most disparate kingdoms. They have not conceived
the world in their own image any more than they have conceived
themselves in the world's image: they have done both at the
same time. Into the idea they have formed of things, they have
undoubtedly made human elements enter; but into the idea
they have formed of themselves, they have made enter elements
coming from things.</p>

<p>Yet there is nothing in experience which could suggest these
connections and confusions. As far as the observation of the
senses is able to go, everything is different and disconnected.
Nowhere do we really see beings mixing their natures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
metamorphosing themselves into each other. It is therefore
necessary that some exceptionally powerful cause should have
intervened to transfigure reality in such a way as to make it
appear under an aspect that is not really its own.</p>

<p>It is religion that was the agent of this transfiguration; it is
religious beliefs that have substituted for the world, as it is perceived
by the senses, another different one. This is well shown
by the case of totemism. The fundamental thing in this religion
is that the men of the clan and the different beings whose form
the totemic emblems reproduce pass as being made of the same
essence. Now when this belief was once admitted, the bridge
between the different kingdoms was already built. The man was
represented as a sort of animal or plant; the plants and animals
were thought of as the relatives of men, or rather, all these
beings, so different for the senses, were thought of as participating
in a single nature. So this remarkable aptitude for confusing
things that seem to be obviously distinct comes from the
fact that the first forces with which the human intellect has
peopled the world were elaborated by religion. Since these
were made up of elements taken from the different kingdoms,
men conceived a principle common to the most heterogeneous
things, which thus became endowed with a sole and single
essence.</p>

<p>But we also know that these religious conceptions are the
result of determined social causes. Since the clan cannot exist
without a name and an emblem, and since this emblem is always
before the eyes of men, it is upon this, and the objects whose
image it is, that the sentiments which society arouses in its
members are fixed. Men were thus compelled to represent
the collective force, whose action they felt, in the form of the
thing serving as flag to the group. Therefore, in the idea of this
force were mixed up the most different kingdoms; in one sense,
it was essentially human, since it was made up of human ideas
and sentiments; but at the same time, it could not fail to appear
as closely related to the animate or inanimate beings who gave
it its outward form. Moreover, the cause whose action we observe
here is not peculiar to totemism; there is no society where it
is not active. In a general way, a collective sentiment can become
conscious of itself only by being fixed upon some material
object;<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> but by this very fact, it participates in the nature
of this object, and reciprocally, the object participates in its
nature. So it was social necessity which brought about the
fusion of notions appearing distinct at first, and social life
has facilitated this fusion by the great mental effervescences it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
determines.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> This is one more proof that logical understanding
is a function of society, for it takes the forms and attitudes
that this latter presses upon it.</p>

<p>It is true that this logic is disconcerting for us. Yet we must
be careful not to depreciate it: howsoever crude it may appear
to us, it has been an aid of the greatest importance in the intellectual
evolution of humanity. In fact, it is through it that
the first explanation of the world has been made possible. Of
course the mental habits it implies prevented men from seeing
reality as their senses show it to them; but as they show it,
it has the grave inconvenience of allowing of no explanation.
For to explain is to attach things to each other and to establish
relations between them which make them appear to us as functions
of each other and as vibrating sympathetically according
to an internal law founded in their nature. But sensations,
which see nothing except from the outside, could never make
them disclose these relations and internal bonds; the intellect
alone can create the notion of them. When I learn that A regularly
precedes B, my knowledge is increased by a new fact;
but my intelligence is not at all satisfied with a statement which
does not show its reason. I commence to <i>understand</i> only if
it is possible for me to conceive B in a way that makes it appear
to me as something that is not foreign to A, and as united to A
by some relation of kinship. The great service that religions have
rendered to thought is that they have constructed a first representation
of what these relations of kinship between things
may be. In the circumstances under which it was attempted,
the enterprise could obviously attain only precarious results.
But then, does it ever attain any that are definite, and is it not
always necessary to reconsider them? And also, it is less important
to succeed than to try. The essential thing was not to
leave the mind enslaved to visible appearances, but to teach it
to dominate them and to connect what the senses separated;
for from the moment when men have an idea that there are
internal connections between things, science and philosophy
become possible. Religion opened up the way for them. But if
it has been able to play this part, it is only because it is a social
affair. In order to make a law for the impressions of the senses
and to substitute a new way of representing reality for them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
thought of a new sort had to be founded: this is collective
thought. If this alone has had this efficacy, it is because of the
fact that to create a world of ideals through which the world of
experienced realities would appear transfigured, a super-excitation
of the intellectual forces was necessary, which is possible only in
and through society.</p>

<p>So it is far from true that this mentality has no connection
with ours. Our logic was born of this logic. The explanations
of contemporary science are surer of being objective because
they are more methodical and because they rest on more carefully
controlled observations, but they do not differ in nature from
those which satisfy primitive thought. To-day, as formerly, to
explain is to show how one thing participates in one or several
others. It has been said that the participations of this sort
implied by the mythologies violate the principle of contradiction
and that they are by that opposed to those implied by scientific
explanations.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Is not the statement that a man is a kangaroo
or the sun a bird, equal to identifying the two with each other?
But our manner of thought is not different when we say of heat
that it is a movement, or of light that it is a vibration of the ether,
etc. Every time that we unite heterogeneous terms by an internal
bond, we forcibly identify contraries. Of course the terms we
unite are not those which the Australian brings together; we
choose them according to different criteria and for different
reasons; but the processes by which the mind puts them in
connection do not differ essentially.</p>

<p>It is true that if primitive thought had that sort of general
and systematic indifference to contradictions which has been
attributed to it,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> it would be in open contradiction on this
point with modern thought, which is always careful to remain
consistent with itself. But we do not believe that it is possible
to characterize the mentality of inferior societies by a single
and exclusive inclination for indistinction. If the primitive
confounds things which we distinguish, he also distinguishes
things which we connect together, and he even conceives these
distinctions in the form of sharp and clear-cut oppositions. Between
two things which are classified in two different phratries,
there is not only separation, but even antagonism.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> For this
reason, the same Australian who confounds the sun and the
white cockatoo, opposes this latter to the black cockatoo as to its
contrary. The two seem to him to belong to two separate
classes between which there is nothing in common. A still
more marked opposition is that existing between sacred things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and profane things. They repel and contradict each other with
so much force that the mind refuses to think of them at the same
time. They mutually expel each other from the consciousness.</p>

<p>Thus between the logic of religious thought and that of scientific
thought there is no abyss. The two are made up of the same
elements, though inequally and differently developed. The
special characteristic of the former seems to be its natural
taste for immoderate confusions as well as sharp contrasts. It
is voluntarily excessive in each direction. When it connects,
it confounds; when it distinguishes, it opposes. It knows no
shades and measures, it seeks extremes; it consequently employs
logical mechanisms with a certain awkwardness, but it ignores
none of them.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER VIII</b><br /><br />

<small>THE IDEA OF THE SOUL</small></h3>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have been studying the fundamental
principles of the totemic religion. We have seen
that no idea of soul or spirit or mythical personality is to be
found among these. Yet, even if the idea of spiritual beings is
not at the foundation of totemism or, consequently, of religious
thought in general, still, there is no religion where this notion
is not met with. So it is important to see how it is formed. To
make sure that it is the product of a secondary formation, we
must discover the way in which it is derived from the more
essential conceptions which we have just described and explained.</p>

<p>Among the various spiritual beings, there is one which should
receive our attention first of all because it is the prototype
after which the others have been constructed: this is the soul.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Just as there is no known society without a religion, so there
exist none, howsoever crudely organized they may be, where
we do not find a whole system of collective representations
concerning the soul, its origin and its destiny. So far as we
are able to judge from the data of ethnology, the idea of the
soul seems to have been contemporaneous with humanity
itself, and it seems to have had all of its essential characteristics
so well formulated at the very outset that the work of the more
advanced religions and philosophy has been practically confined
to refining it, while adding nothing that is really fundamental.
In fact, all the Australian societies admit that every human
body shelters an interior being, the principle of the life which
animates it: this is the soul. It sometimes happens, it is true,
that women form an exception to this general rule: there are
tribes where they are believed to have no souls.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> If Dawson
is to be believed, it is the same with young children in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
tribes that he has observed.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> But these are exceptional and
probably late cases;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> the last one even seems to be suspect
and may well be due to an erroneous interpretation of the
facts.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>It is not easy to determine the idea which the Australian makes
of the soul, because it is so obscure and floating; but we should
not be surprised at this. If someone asked our own contemporaries,
or even those of them who believe most firmly in the
existence of the soul, how they represented it, the replies that
he would receive would not have much more coherence and
precision. This is because we are dealing with a very complex
notion, into which a multitude of badly analysed impressions
enter, whose elaboration has been carried on for centuries,
though men have had no clear consciousness of it. Yet from this
come the most essential, though frequently contradictory,
characteristics by which it is defined.</p>

<p>In some cases they tell us that it has the external appearance
of the body.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> But sometimes it is also represented as having
the size of a grain of sand; its dimensions are so reduced that it
can pass through the smallest crevices or the finest tissues.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> We
shall also see that it is represented in the appearance of animals.
This shows that its form is essentially inconsistent and undetermined;<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
it varies from one moment to another with the
demands of circumstances or according to the exigencies of the
myth and the rite. The substance out of which it is made is no
less indefinable. It is not without matter, for it has a form,
howsoever vague this may be. And in fact, even during this
life, it has physical needs: it eats, and inversely, it may be
eaten. Sometimes it leaves the body, and in the course of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
travels it occasionally nourishes itself on foreign souls.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> After
it has once been completely freed from the organism, it is thought
to lead a life absolutely analogous to the one it led in this world;
it eats, drinks, hunts, etc.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> When it flutters among the branches
of trees, it causes rustlings and crackings which even profane
ears hear.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> But at the same time, it is believed to be invisible
to the vulgar.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> It is true that magicians or old men have the
faculty of seeing souls; but it is in virtue of special powers
which they owe either to age or to a special training that they
perceive things which escape our senses. According to Dawson,
ordinary individuals enjoy the same privilege at only one moment
of their existence: when they are on the eve of a premature
death. Therefore this quasi-miraculous vision is considered a
sinister omen. Now, invisibility is generally considered one of
the signs of spirituality. So the soul is conceived as being
immaterial to a certain degree, for it does not affect the senses
in the way bodies do: it has no bones, as the tribes of the Tully
River say.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> In order to conciliate all these opposed characteristics,
they represent it as made of some infinitely rare and subtle
matter, like something ethereal,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> and comparable to a shadow
or breath.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>It is distinct and independent of the body, for during this
life it can leave it at any moment. It does leave it during sleep,
fainting spells, etc.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> It may even remain absent for some time
without entailing death; however, during these absences life
is weakened and even stops if the soul does not return home.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
But it is especially at death that this distinction and independence
manifest themselves with the greatest clarity. While the body
no longer exists and no visible traces of it remain, the soul
continues to live: it leads an autonomous existence in another
world.</p>

<p>But howsoever real this duality may be, it is in no way absolute.
It would show a grave misunderstanding to represent the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
as a sort of habitat in which the soul resides, but with which it
has only external relations. Quite on the contrary, it is united
to it by the closest bonds; it is separable from it only imperfectly
and with difficulty. We have already seen that it has, or at least
is able to have, its external aspect. Consequently, everything
that hurts the one hurts the other; every wound of the body
spreads to the soul.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> It is so intimately associated with the life
of the organism that it grows with it and decays with it. This
is why a man who has attained a certain age enjoys privileges
refused to young men; it is because the religious principle
within him has acquired greater force and efficacy as he has
advanced in life. But when senility sets in, and the old man
is no longer able to take a useful part in the great religious
ceremonies in which the vital interests of the tribe are concerned,
this respect is no longer accorded to him. It is thought that
weakness of the body is communicated to the soul. Having
the same powers no longer, he no longer has a right to the same
prestige.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>There is not only a close union of soul and body, but there is
also a partial confusion of the two. Just as there is something
of the body in the soul, since it sometimes reproduces its form,
so there is something of the soul in the body. Certain regions
and certain products of the organism are believed to have a
special affinity with it: such is the case with the heart, the
breath, the placenta,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> the blood,<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> the shadow,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> the liver, the fat
of the liver, the kidneys,<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> etc. These various material substrata
are not mere habitations of the soul; they are the soul itself
seen from without. When blood flows, the soul escapes with
it. The soul is not in the breath; it is the breath. It and the
part of the body where it resides are only one. Hence comes
the conception according to which a man has a number of souls.
Being dispersed in various parts of the organism, the soul is
differentiated and broken up into fragments. Each organ has
individualized, as it were, the portion of the soul which it contains,
and which has thus become a distinct entity. The soul of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the heart could not be that of the breath or the shadow or the
placenta. While they are all related, still they are to be distinguished,
and even have different names.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, even if the soul is localized especially in certain
parts of the organism, it is not absent from the others. In varying
degrees, it is diffused through the whole body, as is well shown
by the funeral rites. After the last breath has been expired and
the soul is believed to be gone, it seems as though it should profit
by the liberty thus regained, to move about at will and to return
as quickly as possible to its real home, which is elsewhere. Nevertheless,
it remains near to the corpse; the bond uniting them
has been loosened, but not broken. A whole series of special
rites are necessary to induce it to depart definitely. It is invited
to go by gestures and significant movements.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> The way is laid
open for it, and outlets are arranged so that it can go more easily.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
This is because it has not left the body entirely; it was too
closely united to it to break away all at once. Hence comes
the very frequent rite of funeral anthropophagy; the flesh of
the dead is eaten because it is thought to contain a sacred principle,
which is really nothing more than the soul.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> In order to drive it
out definitely, the flesh is melted, either by submitting it to the
heat of the sun,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> or to that of an artificial fire.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> The soul departs
with the liquids which result. But even the dry bones still retain
some part of it. Therefore they can be used as sacred objects
or instruments of magic;<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> or if someone wishes to give complete
liberty to the principle which they contain, he breaks these.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>But a moment does arrive when the final separation is accomplished;
the liberated soul takes flight. But by nature it is so
intimately associated with the body that this removal cannot take
place without a profound change in its condition. So it takes
a new name also.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> Although keeping all the distinctive traits
of the individual whom it animated, his humours and his good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and bad qualities,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> still it has become a new being. From that
moment a new existence commences for it.</p>

<p>It goes to the land of souls. This land is conceived differently
by different tribes; sometimes different conceptions are found
existing side by side in the same society. For some, it is situated
under the earth, where each totemic group has its part. This is
at the spot where the first ancestors, the founders of the clan,
entered the ground at a certain time, and where they live since
their death. In the subterranean world there is a geographical
disposition of the dead corresponding to that of the living.
There, the sun always shines and rivers flow which never run
dry. Such is the conception which Spencer and Gillen attribute
to the central tribes, Arunta,<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Warramunga,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> etc. It is found
again among the Wotjobaluk.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> In other places, all the dead,
no matter what their totems may have been, are believed to live
together in the same place, which is more or less vaguely localized
as beyond the sea, in an island,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> or on the shores of a lake.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
Sometimes, finally, it is into the sky, beyond the clouds, that the
souls are thought to go. "There," says Dawson, "there is a
delectable land, abounding in kangaroos and game of every sort,
where men lead a happy life. Souls meet again there and recognize
one another."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> It is probable that certain of the features
of this picture have been taken from the paradise of the Christian
missionaries;<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> but the idea that souls, or at least some souls,
enter the skies after death appears to be quite indigenous; for
it is found again in other parts of the continent.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>In general, all the souls meet the same fate and lead the same
life. However, a different treatment is sometimes accorded
them based on the way they have conducted themselves upon
earth, and we can see the first outlines of these two distinct
and even opposed compartments into which the world to come
will later be divided. The souls of those who have excelled,
during life, as hunters, warriors, dancers, etc., are not confounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
with the common horde of the others; a special place is granted
to them.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Sometimes, this is the sky.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Strehlow even says that

dreadful spirits, and destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Nevertheless, these conceptions

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Such are the beliefs relative to the soul and its destiny, in
their most primitive form, and reduced to their most essential
traits. We must now attempt to explain them. What is it that
has been able to lead men into thinking that there are two beings
in them, one of which possesses these very special characteristics
which we have just enumerated? To find the reply to this
question, let us begin by seeking the origin attributed to this
spiritual principle by the primitive himself: if it is well analysed,
his own conception will put us on the way towards the solution.</p>

<p>Following out the method which we have set before ourselves,
we shall study these ideas in a determined group of societies
where they have been observed with an especial precision; these
are the tribes of Central Australia. Though not narrow, the area
of our observations will be limited. But there is good reason
for believing that these same ideas are quite generally held, in
various forms, even outside of Australia. It is also to be noted
that the idea of the soul, as it is found among these central
tribes, does not differ specifically from the one found in other
tribes; it has the same essential characteristics everywhere.
As one effect always has the same cause, we may well think
that this idea, which is everywhere the same, does not result
from one cause here and another there. So the origin which
we shall be led to attribute to it as a result of our study of these
particular tribes with which we are going to deal, ought to be
equally true for the others. These tribes will give us a chance
to make an experiment, as it were, whose results, like those of
every well-made experiment, are susceptible of generalization.
The homogeneity of the Australian civilization would of itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
be enough to justify this generalization; but we shall be careful
to verify it afterwards with facts taken from other peoples, both
in Australia and America.</p>

<p>As the conceptions which are going to furnish us with the
basis of our demonstration have been reported in different
terms by Spencer and Gillen on the one hand and Strehlow on the
other, we must give these two versions one after the other.
We shall see that when they are well understood, they differ in
form more than in matter, and that they both have the same
sociological significance.</p>

<p>According to Spencer and Gillen, the souls which, in each
generation, come to animate the bodies of newly-born children,
are not special and original creations; all these tribes hold that
there is a definite stock of souls, whose number cannot be augmented
at all,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and which reincarnate themselves periodically.
When an individual dies, his soul quits the body in which it dwelt,
and after the mourning is accomplished, it goes to the land of the
souls; but after a certain length of time, it returns to incarnate
itself again, and these reincarnations are the cause of conception
and birth. At the beginning of things, it was these fundamental
souls which animated the first ancestors, the founders of the clan.
At an epoch, beyond which the imagination does not go and which
is considered the very beginning of time, there were certain
beings who were not derived from any others. For this reason,
the Arunta call them the <i>Altjirangamitjina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> the uncreated ones,
those who exist from all eternity, and, according to Spencer
and Gillen, they give the name <i>Alcheringa</i><a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> to the period when
these fabulous beings are thought to have lived. Being organized
in totemic clans just as the men of to-day are, they passed their
time in travels, in the course of which they accomplished all sorts
of prodigious actions, the memory of which is preserved in the
myths. But a moment arrived when this terrestrial life came to
a close; singly or in groups, they entered into the earth. But
their souls live for ever; they are immortal. They even continue
to frequent the places where the existence of their former hosts
came to an end. Moreover, owing to the memories attached to
them, these places have a sacred character; it is here that the
oknanikilla are located, the sorts of sanctuaries where the churinga
of the clan is kept, and the centres of the different totemic cults.
When one of the souls which wander about these sanctuaries
enters into the body of a woman, the result is a conception and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
later a birth.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> So each individual is considered as a new appearance
of a determined ancestor: it is this ancestor himself, come
back in a new body and with new features. Now, what were
these ancestors?</p>

<p>In the first place, they were endowed with powers infinitely
superior to those possessed by men to-day, even the most respected
old men and the most celebrated magicians. They are
attributed virtues which we may speak of as miraculous: "They
could travel on, or above, or beneath the ground; by opening a
vein in the arm, each of them could flood whole tracts of country
or cause level plains to arise; in rocky ranges they could make
pools of water spring into existence, or could make deep gorges
and gaps through which to traverse the ranges, and where they
planted their sacred poles (nurtunja), there rocks or trees arose
to mark the spot."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> It is they who gave the earth the form it
has at present. They created all sorts of beings, both men and
animals. They are nearly gods. So their souls also have a
divine character. And since the souls of men are these ancestral
souls reincarnated in the human body, these are sacred beings too.</p>

<p>In the second place, these ancestors were not men in the proper
sense of the word, but animals or vegetables, or perhaps mixed
beings in which the animal or vegetable element predominated:
"In the Alcheringa," say Spencer and Gillen, "lived ancestors
who, in the native mind, are so intimately associated with the
animals or plants the name of which they bear that an Alcheringa
man of, say, the kangaroo totem may sometimes be spoken of
either as a man-kangaroo or a kangaroo-man. The identity of
the human individual is often sunk in that of the animal or plant
from which he is supposed to have originated."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Their immortal
souls necessarily have the same nature; in them, also, the
human element is wedded to the animal element, with a certain
tendency for the latter to predominate over the former. So they
are made of the same substance as the totemic principle, for
we know that the special characteristic of this is to present this
double nature, and to synthesize and confound the two realms
in itself.</p>

<p>Since no other souls than these exist, we reach the conclusion
that, in a general way, the soul is nothing other than the totemic
principle incarnate in each individual. And there is nothing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
surprise us in this derivation. We already know that this
principle is immanent in each of the members of the clan. But in
penetrating into these individuals, it must inevitably individualize
itself. Because the consciousnesses, of which it becomes thus an
integral part, differ from each other, it differentiates itself according
to their image; since each has its own physiognomy, it takes
a distinct physiognomy in each. Of course it remains something
outside of and foreign to the man, but the portion of it which
each is believed to possess cannot fail to contract close affinities
with the particular subject in which it resides; it becomes his
to a certain extent. Thus it has two contradictory characteristics,
but whose coexistence is one of the distinctive features of
the notion of the soul. To-day, as formerly, the soul is what is
best and most profound in ourselves, and the pre-eminent part of
our being; yet it is also a passing guest which comes from the
outside, which leads in us an existence distinct from that of the
body, and which should one day regain its entire independence.
In a word, just as society exists only in and through individuals,
the totemic principle exists only in and through the individual
consciousnesses whose association forms the clan. If they did
not feel it in them it would not exist; it is they who put it into
things. So it must of necessity be divided and distributed among
them. Each of these fragments is a soul.</p>

<p>A myth which is found in a rather large number of the societies
of the centre, and which, moreover, is only a particular form of
the preceding ones, shows even better that this is really the
matter out of which the idea of the soul is made. In these tribes,
tradition puts the origin of each clan, not in a number of ancestors,
but in only two,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> or even in one.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> This unique being, as long as
he remained single, contained the totemic principle within him
integrally, for at this moment there was nothing to which this
principle could be communicated. Now, according to this same
tradition, all the human souls which exist, both those which
now animate the bodies of men and those which are at present
unemployed, being held in reserve for the future, have issued
from this unique personage; they are made of his substance.
While travelling over the surface of the ground, or moving about,
or shaking himself, he made them leave his body and planted
them in the various places he is believed to have passed over.
Is this not merely a symbolic way of saying that they are parts
of the totemic divinity?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But this conclusion presupposes that the tribes of which we
have just been speaking admit the doctrine of reincarnation.
Now according to Strehlow, this doctrine is unknown to the
Arunta, the society which Spencer and Gillen have studied the
longest and the best. If, in this particular case, these two
observers have misunderstood things to such an extent, their
whole testimony would become suspect. So it is important to
determine the actual extent of this divergence.</p>

<p>According to Strehlow, after the soul has once been definitely
freed from the body by the rites of mourning, it never reincarnates
itself again. It goes off to the isles of the dead, where it
passes its days in sleeping and its nights in dancing, until it
returns again to earth. Then it comes back into the midst of
the living and plays the r&ocirc;le of protecting genius to the young
sons, or if such are lacking, to the grandsons whom the dead
man left behind him; it enters their body and aids their growth.
It remains thus in the midst of its former family for a year or
two, after which it goes back to the land of the souls. But after
a certain length of time it goes away once more to make another
sojourn upon earth, which is to be the last. A time will come
when it must take up again, and with no hope of return this time,
the route to the isles of the dead; then, after various incidents,
the details of which it is useless to relate, a storm will overtake it,
in the course of which it will be struck by a flash of lightning.
Thus its career is definitely terminated.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>So it cannot reincarnate itself; nor can conceptions and births
be due to the reincarnation of souls which periodically commence
new existences in new bodies. It is true that Strehlow, as Spencer
and Gillen, declares that for the Arunta commerce of the sexes
is in no way the determining condition of generation,<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> which is
considered the result of mystic operations, but different from the
ones which the other observers told us about. It takes place in
one or the other of the two following ways:</p>

<p>Wherever an ancestor of the Alcheringa<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> times is believed to
have entered into the ground, there is either a stone or a tree
representing his body. The tree or rock which has this mystic
relation with the departed hero is called <i>nanja</i> according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Spencer and Gillen,<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> or <i>ngarra</i> according to Strehlow.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Sometimes
it is a water-hole which is believed to have been formed in
this way. Now, on each of these trees or rocks and in each of
these water-holes, there live embryo children, called <i>ratapa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
which belong to exactly the same totem as the corresponding
ancestor. For example, on a gum-tree representing an ancestor
of the kangaroo totem there are ratapa, all of which have the
kangaroo as their totem. If a woman happens to pass it, and
she is of the matrimonial class to which the mothers of these
ratapa should belong,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> one of them may enter her through the
hip. The woman learns of this act by the characteristic pains
which are the first symptoms of pregnancy. The child thus
conceived will of course belong to the same totem as the ancestor
upon whose mystical body he resided before becoming incarnate.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>In other cases, the process employed is slightly different: the
ancestor himself acts in person. At a given moment he leaves
his subterranean retreat and throws on to the passing woman a
little churinga of a special form, called <i>namatuna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> The churinga
enters the body of the woman and takes a human form there,
while the ancestor disappears again into the earth.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>These two ways of conception are believed to be equally
frequent. The features of the child will reveal the manner in
which he was conceived; according to whether his face is broad
or long, they say that he is the incarnation of a ratapa or a
namatuna. Beside these two means of fecundation, Strehlow
places a third, which, however, is much more rare. After his
namatuna has penetrated into the body of the woman, the ancestor
himself enters her and voluntarily submits to a new birth.
So in this case, the conception is due to a real reincarnation of
the ancestor. But this is very exceptional, and when a man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
has been conceived thus dies, the ancestral soul which animated
him goes away, just like ordinary souls, to the isles of the dead
where, after the usual delays, it is definitely annihilated. So it
cannot undergo any further reincarnations.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Such is the version of Strehlow.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> In the opinion of this author
it is radically opposed to that of Spencer and Gillen. But in
reality it differs only in the letter of the formul&aelig; and symbols,
while in both cases we find the same mythical theme in slightly
different forms.</p>

<p>In the first place, all the observers agree that every conception
is the result of an incarnation. Only according to Strehlow, that
which is incarnated is not a soul but a ratapa or a namatuna.
But what is a ratapa? Strehlow says that it is a complete
embryo, made up of a soul and a body. But the soul is always
represented in material forms; it sleeps, dances, hunts, eats, etc.
So it, too, has a corporal element. Inversely, the ratapa is invisible
to ordinary men; no one sees it as it enters the body of
the woman;<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> this is equivalent to saying that it is made of a
matter quite similar to that of the soul. So it hardly seems possible
to differentiate the two clearly in this regard. In reality,
these are mythical beings which are obviously conceived after
the same model. Schulze calls them the souls of children.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
Moreover, the ratapa, just like the soul, sustains the closest
relations with the ancestor of which the sacred tree or rock is the
materialized form. It is of the same totem as this ancestor, of
the same phratry and of the same matrimonial class.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Its place
in the social organization of the tribe is the very one that its
ancestor is believed to have held before it. It bears the same
name,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> which is a proof that these two personalities are at least
very closely related to one another.</p>

<p>But there is more than this; this relationship even goes as
far as a complete identification. In fact, it is on the mystic body
of the ancestor that the ratapa is formed; it comes from this;
it is like a detached portion of it. So it really is a part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
ancestor which penetrates into the womb of the mother and
which becomes the child. Thus we get back to the conception
of Spencer and Gillen: birth is due to the reincarnation of an
ancestral personage. Of course it is not the entire person that
is reincarnated, it is only an emanation from him. But this
difference has only a secondary interest, for when a sacred being
divides and duplicates itself, all of its essential characteristics
are to be found again in each of the fragments into which it is
broken up. So really the Alcheringa ancestor is entire in each
part of himself which becomes a ratapa.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>The second mode of conception distinguished by Strehlow has
the same significance. In fact, the churinga, and more especially
the particular churinga that is called the namatuna, is considered
a transformation of the ancestor; according to Strehlow,<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> it is
his body, just as the nanja tree is. In other words, the personality
of the ancestor, his churinga and his nanja tree, are sacred
things, inspiring the same sentiments and to which the same
religious value is attributed. So they transmute themselves into
one another: in the spot where an ancestor lost his churinga, a
sacred tree or rock has come out of the soil, just the same as in
those places where he entered the ground himself.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> So there is
a mythological equivalence of a person of the Alcheringa and his
churinga; consequently, when the former throws a namatuna
into the body of a woman, it is as if he entered into it himself.
In fact, we have seen that sometimes he does enter in person
after the namatuna; according to other stories he precedes it;
it might be said that he opens up the way for it.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> The fact that
these two themes exist side by side in the same myth completes
the proof that one is only a doublet of the other.</p>

<p>Moreover, in whatever way the conception may have taken
place, there can be no doubt that each individual is united to
some determined ancestor of the Alcheringa by especially close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
bonds. In the first place, each man has his appointed ancestor;
two persons cannot have the same one simultaneously. In other
words, a being of the Alcheringa never has more than one representative
among the living.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> More than that, the one is only an
aspect of the other. In fact, as we already know, the churinga left
by the ancestor expresses his personality; if we adopt the interpretation
of Strehlow, which, perhaps, is the more satisfactory,
we shall say that it is his body. But this same churinga is related
in the same way to the individual who is believed to have been
conceived under the influence of this ancestor, and who is the
fruit of his mystic works. When the young initiate is introduced
into the sanctuary of the clan, he is shown the churinga of his
ancestor, and someone says to him, "You are this body; you
are the same thing as this."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> So, in Strehlow's own expression,
the churinga is "the body common to the individual and his
ancestor."<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Now if they are to have the same body it is necessary
that on one side at least their two personalities be confounded.
Strehlow recognizes this explicitly, moreover, when
he says, "By the tjurunga (churinga) the individual is united to
his personal ancestor."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>So for Strehlow as well as for Spencer and Gillen, there is a
mystic, religious principle in each new-born child, which emanates
from an ancestor of the Alcheringa. It is this principle which
forms the essence of each individual, therefore it is his soul, or in
any case the soul is made of the same matter and the same substance.
Now it is only upon this one fundamental fact that we
have relied in determining the nature and origin of the idea of
the soul. The different metaphors by means of which it may
have been expressed have only a secondary interest for us.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Far from contradicting the data upon which our theory rests,
the recent observations of Strehlow bring new proofs confirming
it. Our reasoning consisted in inferring the totemic nature of
the human soul from the totemic nature of the ancestral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
soul, of which the former is an emanation and a sort of replica.
Now, some of the new facts which we owe to Strehlow show
this character of both even more categorically than those we
had at our disposal before do. In the first place, Strehlow, like
Spencer and Gillen, insists on "the intimate relations uniting
each ancestor to an animal, to a plant, or to some other natural
object." Some of these Altjirangamitjina (these are Spencer
and Gillen's men of the Alcheringa) "should," he says, "be
manifested directly as animals; others take the animal form in
a way."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Even now they are constantly transforming themselves
into animals.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> In any case, whatever external aspect they may
have, "the special and distinctive qualities of the animal clearly
appear in each of them." For example, the ancestors of the
Kangaroo clan eat grass just like real kangaroos, and flee before
the hunter; those of the Emu clan run and feed like emus,<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> etc.
More than that, those ancestors who had a vegetable as totem
become this vegetable itself on death.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Moreover, this close
kinship of the ancestor and the totemic being is so keenly felt
by the natives that it is shown even in their terminology. Among
the Arunta, the child calls the totem of his mother, which serves
him as a secondary totem,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> <i>altjira</i>. As filiation was at first in the
uterine line, there was once a time when each individual had no
other totem than that of his mother; so it is very probable that
the term <i>altjira</i> then designated the real totem. Now this clearly
enters into the composition of the word which means great
ancestor, <i>altjirangamitjina</i>.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>The idea of the totem and that of the ancestor are even so
closely kindred that they sometimes seem to be confounded.
Thus, after speaking of the totem of the mother, or <i>altjira</i>,
Strehlow goes on to say, "This altjira appears to the natives in
dreams and gives them warnings, just as it takes information
concerning them to their sleeping friends."<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> This <i>altjira</i>, which
speaks and which is attached to each individual personally, is
evidently an ancestor; yet it is also an incarnation of the totem.
A certain text in Roth, which speaks of invocations addressed to
the totem, should certainly be interpreted in this sense.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> So it
appears that the totem is sometimes represented in the mind in
the form of a group of ideal beings or mythical personages who
are more or less indistinct from the ancestors. In a word, the
ancestors are the fragments of the totem.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the ancestor is so readily confused with the totemic
being, the individual soul, which is so near the ancestral soul,
cannot do otherwise. Moreover, this is what actually results
from the close union of each man with his churinga. In fact, we
know that the churinga represents the personality of the individual
who is believed to have been born of it;<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> but it also
expresses the totemic animal. When the civilizing hero, Mangarkunjerkunja,
presented each member of the Kangaroo clan
with his personal totem, he spoke as follows: "Here is the body
of a kangaroo."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> Thus the churinga is at once the body of the
ancestor, of the individual himself and of the totemic animal;
so, according to a strong and very just expression of Strehlow,
these three beings form a "solid unity."<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> They are almost
equivalent and interchangeable terms. This is as much as to
say that they are thought of as different aspects of one and the
same reality, which is also defined by the distinctive attributes
of the totem. Their common essence is the totemic principle.
The language itself expresses this identity. The word ratapa,
and the <i>aratapi</i> of the Loritja language, designate the mythical
embryo which is detached from the ancestor and which becomes
the child; now these same words also designate the totem of
this same child, such as is determined by the spot where the
mother believes that she conceived.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Up to the present we have studied the doctrine of reincarnation
only in the tribes of Central Australia; therefore the bases
upon which our inference rests may be deemed too narrow.
But in the first place, for the reasons which we have pointed out,
the experiment holds good outside of the societies which we have
observed directly. Also, there are abundant facts proving that
the same or analogous conceptions are found in the most diverse
parts of Australia or, at least, have left very evident traces there.
They are found even in America.</p>

<p>Howitt mentions them among the Dieri of South Australia.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>
The word <i>Mura-mura</i>, which Gason translates with Good Spirit
and which he thinks expresses a belief in a god creator,<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> is really
a collective word designating the group of ancestors placed by
the myth at the beginning of the tribe. They continue to exist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
to-day as formerly. "They are believed to live in trees, which
are sacred for this reason." Certain irregularities of the ground,
rocks and springs are identified with these Mura-mura,<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> which
consequently resemble the Altjirangamitjina of the Arunta in a
singular way. The Kurnai of Gippsland, though retaining only
vestiges of totemism, also believe in the existence of ancestors
called <i>Muk-Kurnai</i>, and which they think of as beings intermediate
between men and animals.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Among the Nimbaldi,
Taplin has observed a theory of conception similar to that which
Strehlow attributes to the Arunta.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> We find this belief in reincarnation
held integrally by the Wotjobaluk in Victoria.
"The spirits of the dead," says Mathews, "assemble in the
<i>miyur</i><a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> of their respective clans; they leave these to be born
again in human form when a favourable occasion presents
itself."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Mathews even affirms that "the belief in the reincarnation
or transmigration of souls is strongly enrooted in all the
Australian tribes."<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>If we pass to the northern regions we find the pure doctrine
of the Arunta among the Niol-Niol in the north-west; every
birth is attributed to the incarnation of a pre-existing soul,
which introduces itself into the body of a woman.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> In northern
Queensland myths, differing from the preceding only in form,
express exactly the same ideas. Among the tribes on the Pennefather
River it is believed that every man has two souls: the
one, called <i>ngai</i>, resides in the heart; the other, called <i>choi</i>,
remains in the placenta. Soon after birth the placenta is buried
in a consecrated place. A particular genius, named Anje-a, who
has charge of the phenomena of procreation, comes to get this
<i>choi</i> and keeps it until the child, being grown up, is married.
When the time comes to give him a son, Anje-a takes a bit of
the choi of this man, places it in the embryo he is making, and
inserts it into the womb of the mother. So it is out of the soul
of the father that that of the child is made. It is true that the
child does not receive the paternal soul integrally at first, for
the <i>ngai</i> remains in the heart of the father as long as he lives.
But when he dies the <i>ngai</i>, being liberated, also incarnates itself
in the bodies of the children; if there are several children it is
divided equally among them. Thus there is a perfect spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
continuity between the generations; it is the same soul which is
transmitted from a father to his children and from these to their
children, and this unique soul, always remaining itself in spite
of its successive divisions and subdivisions, is the one which
animated the first ancestor at the beginning of all things.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>
Between this theory and the one held by the central tribes there
is only one difference of any importance; this is that the reincarnation
is not the work of the ancestors themselves but that of
a special genius who takes charge of this function professionally.
But it seems probable that this genius is the product of a syncretism
which has fused the numerous figures of the first ancestors
into one single being. This hypothesis is at least made probable
by the fact that the words Anje-a and Anjir are evidently very
closely related; now the second designates the first man, the
original ancestor from whom all men are descended.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>These same ideas are found again among the Indian tribes
of America. Krauss says that among the Tlinkit, the souls of
the departed are believed to come back to earth and introduce
themselves into the bodies of the pregnant women of their families.
"So when a woman dreams, during pregnancy, of some deceased
relative, she believes that the soul of this latter has penetrated
into her. If the young child has some characteristic mark which
the dead man had before, they believe that it is the dead man
himself come back to earth, and his name is given to the child."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
This belief is also general among the Haida. It is the shaman
who reveals which relative it was who reincarnated himself in
the child and what name should consequently be given to him.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>
Among the Kwakiutl it is believed that the latest member of a
family who died comes back to life in the person of the first child
to be born in that family.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> It is the same with the Hurons, the
Iroquois, the Tinneh, and many other tribes of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>


<p class="npara">The universality of these conceptions extends, of course, to
the conclusion which we have deduced from them, that is, to
the explanation of the idea of the soul which we have proposed.
Its general acceptability is also proved by the following facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>We know<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> that each individual contains within him something
of that anonymous force which is diffused in the sacred species;
he is a member of this species himself. But as an empirical
and visible being, he is not, for, in spite of the symbolic designs
and marks with which he decorates his body, there is nothing
in him to suggest the form of an animal or plant. So it must be
that there is another being in him, in whom he recognizes himself,
but whom he represents in the form of an animal or vegetable
species. Now is it not evident that this double can only be the
soul, since the soul is, of itself, already a double of the subject
whom it animates? The justification of this identification is
completed by the fact that the organs where the fragment of the
totemic principle contained in each individual incarnates itself
the most eminently are also those where the soul resides. This
is the case with the blood. The blood contains something of
the nature of the totem, as is proved by the part it takes in the
totemic ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> But at the same time, the blood is one of
the seats of the soul; or rather, it is the soul itself, seen from
without. When blood flows, life runs out and, in the same process,
the soul escapes. So the soul is confused with the sacred principle
which is imminent in the blood.</p>

<p>Regarding matters from another point of view, if our explanation
is well-founded, the totemic principle, in penetrating into
the individual as we suppose, should retain a certain amount
of autonomy there, since it is quite distinct from the subject in
whom it is incarnated. Now this is just what Howitt claims to
have observed among the Yuin: "That in this tribe the totem
is thought to be in some way part of a man is clearly seen by the
case of Umbara, before mentioned, who told me that, many
years ago, someone of the Lace-lizard totem sent it while he
was asleep, and that it went down his throat and almost ate
his totem, which was in his breast, so that he nearly died."<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>
So it is quite true that the totem is broken up in individualizing
itself and that each of the bits thus detached plays the part of
a spirit or soul residing in the body.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>But there are other more clearly demonstrative facts. If the
soul is only the totemic principle individualized, it should have,
in certain cases at least, rather close relations with the animal
or vegetable species whose form is reproduced by the totem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
And, in fact, "the Geawe-Gal (a tribe of New South Wales)
had a superstition that everyone had within himself an affinity
to the spirit of some bird, beast or reptile. Not that he sprung
from the creature in any way, but that the spirit which was in
him was akin to that of the creature."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p>There are even cases where the soul is believed to emanate
directly from the animal or vegetable serving as totem. Among
the Arunta, according to Strehlow, when a woman has eaten a
great deal of fruit, it is believed that she will give birth to a child
who will have this fruit as totem. If, at the moment when she
felt the first tremblings of the child, she was looking at a
kangaroo, it is believed that the ratapa of the kangaroo has
entered her body and fertilized her.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> H. Basedow reported the
same fact from the Wogait.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> We know, also, that the ratapa
and the soul are almost indistinguishable things. Now, such
an origin could never have been attributed to the soul if men did
not think that it was made out of the same substances as the
plants and animals of the totemic species.</p>

<p>Thus the soul is frequently represented in an animal form.
It is known that in inferior societies, death is never considered
a natural event, due to the action of purely physical causes; it
is generally attributed to the evil workings of some sorcerer.
In a large number of Australian societies, in order to determine
who is the responsible author of this murder, they work on the
principle that the soul of the murderer must inevitably come to
visit its victim. Therefore, the body is placed upon a scaffolding;
then, the ground under the corpse and all around it is carefully
smoothed off so that the slightest mark becomes easily perceptible.
They return the next day; if an animal has passed by there
during the interval, its tracks are readily recognizable. Their
form reveals the species to which it belongs, and from that,
they infer the social group of which the guilty man is a member.
They say that it is a man of such a class or such a clan,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to whether the animal is the totem of this or that class or clan.
So the soul is believed to have come in the form of the totemic
animal.</p>

<p>In other societies where totemism has weakened or disappeared,
the soul still continues to be thought of in an animal form.
The natives of Cape Bedford (North Queensland) believe that
the child, at the moment of entering the body of its mother,
is a curlew if it is a girl, or a snake if it is a boy.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> It is only later
that it takes a human form. Many of the Indians of North
America, says the Prince of Wied, say that they have an animal
in their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The Bororo of Brazil represent the soul in the
form of a bird, and therefore believe that they are birds of the
same variety.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> In other places, it is thought of as a snake, a
lizard, a fly, a bee, etc.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>But it is especially after death that this animal nature of the
soul is manifested. During life, this characteristic is partially
veiled, as it were, by the very form of the human body. But
when death has once set it free, it becomes itself again. Among
the Omaha, in at least two of the Buffalo clans, it is believed
that the souls of the dead go to rejoin the buffalo, their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>
The Hopi are divided into a certain number of clans, whose
ancestors were animals or beings with animal forms. Now
Schoolcraft tells us that they say that at death, they take their
original form again; each becomes a bear or deer, according to
the clan to which he belongs.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> Very frequently the soul is
believed to reincarnate itself in the body of an animal.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> It is
probably from this that the widely-spread doctrine of metempsychosis
was derived. We have already seen how hard pressed
Tylor is to account for it.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> If the soul is an essentially human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
principle, what could be more curious than this marked predilection
which it shows, in so large a number of societies, for
the animal form? On the other hand, everything is explained
if, by its very constitution, the soul is closely related to the
animal, for in that case, when it returns to the animal world
at the close of this life, it is only returning to its real nature.
Thus the generality of the belief in metempsychosis is a new
proof that the constituent elements of the idea of the soul have
been taken largely from the animal kingdom, as is presupposed
by the theory which we have just set forth.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Thus the notion of the soul is a particular application of the
beliefs relative to sacred beings. This is the explanation of the
religious character which this idea has had from the moment
when it first appeared in history, and which it still retains to-day.
In fact, the soul has always been considered a sacred thing; on
this ground, it is opposed to the body which is, in itself, profane.
It is not merely distinguished from its material envelope as the
inside from the outside; it is not merely represented as made
out of a more subtle and fluid matter; but more than this, it
inspires those sentiments which are everywhere reserved for that
which is divine. If it is not made into a god, it is at least regarded
as a spark of the divinity. This essential characteristic would be
inexplicable if the idea of the soul were only a pre-scientific
solution given to the problem of dreams; for there is nothing
in the dream to awaken religious emotions, so the cause by which
these are explained could not have such a character. But if
the soul is a part of the divine substance, it represents something
not ourselves that is within us; if it is made of the same mental
matter as the sacred beings, it is natural that it should become
the object of the same sentiments.</p>

<p>And the sacred character which men thus attribute to themselves
is not the product of a pure illusion either; like the notions
of religious force and of divinity, the notion of the soul is not
without a foundation in reality. It is perfectly true that we are
made up of two distinct parts, which are opposed to one another
as the sacred to the profane, and we may say that, in a certain
sense, there is divinity in us. For society, this unique source of
all that is sacred, does not limit itself to moving us from without
and affecting us for the moment; it establishes itself within us
in a durable manner. It arouses within us a whole world of ideas
and sentiments which express it but which, at the same time,
form an integral and permanent part of ourselves. When the
Australian goes away from a religious ceremony, the representations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
which this communal life has aroused or re-aroused within
him are not obliterated in a second. The figures of the great
ancestors, the heroic exploits whose memory these rites perpetuate,
the great deeds of every sort in which he, too, has participated
through the cult, in a word, all these numerous ideals which he
has elaborated with the co-operation of his fellows, continue
to live in his consciousness and, through the emotions which are
attached to them and the ascendancy which they hold over his
entire being, they are sharply distinguished from the vulgar
impressions arising from his daily relations with external things.
Moral ideas have the same character. It is society which forces
them upon us, and as the respect inspired by it is naturally
extended to all that comes from it, its imperative rules of conduct
are invested, by reason of their origin, with an authority and a
dignity which is shared by none of our internal states: therefore,
we assign them a place apart in our psychical life. Although
our moral conscience is a part of our consciousness, we do not
feel ourselves on an equality with it. In this voice which makes
itself heard only to give us orders and establish prohibitions,
we cannot recognize our own voices; the very tone in which it
speaks to us warns us that it expresses something within us
that is not of ourselves. This is the objective foundation of the
idea of the soul: those representations whose flow constitutes
our interior life are of two different species which are irreducible
one into another. Some concern themselves with the external
and material world; others, with an ideal world to which we
attribute a moral superiority over the first. So we are really
made up of two beings facing in different and almost contrary
directions, one of whom exercises a real pre-eminence over the
other. Such is the profound meaning of the antithesis which
all men have more or less clearly conceived between the body
and the soul, the material and the spiritual beings who coexist
within us. Moralists and preachers have often maintained
that no one can deny the reality of duty and its sacred character
without falling into materialism. And it is true that if we
have no idea of moral and religious imperatives, our psychical
life will all be reduced to one level,<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> all our states of consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
will be on the same plane, and all feeling of duality will perish.
To make this duality intelligible, it is, of course, in no way
necessary to imagine a mysterious and unrepresentable substance,
under the name of the soul, which is opposed to the body. But
here, as in regard to the idea of sacredness, the error concerns
the letter of the symbol employed, not the reality of the fact
symbolized. It remains true that our nature is double; there
really is a particle of divinity in us because there is within us
us a particle of these great ideas which are the soul of the
group.</p>


<p class="npara">So the individual soul is only a portion of the collective soul
of the group; it is the anonymous force at the basis of the
cult, but incarnated in an individual whose personality it
espouses; it is <i>mana</i> individualized. Perhaps dreams aided in
determining certain secondary characteristics of the idea. The
inconsistency and instability of the images which fill our minds
during sleep, and their remarkable aptitude for transforming
themselves into one another, may have furnished the model
for this subtile, transparent and Protean matter out of which
the soul is believed to be made. Also, the facts of swooning,
catalepsy, etc., may have suggested the idea that the soul was
mobile, and quitted the body temporarily during this life; this,
in its turn, has served to explain certain dreams. But all these
experiences and observations could have had only a secondary
and complimentary influence, whose very existence it is difficult
to establish. All that is really essential in the idea comes from
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But does not this genesis of the idea of the soul misunderstand
its essential characteristic? If the soul is a particular
form of the impersonal principle which is diffused in the group,
the totemic species and all the things of every sort which are
attached to these, at bottom it is impersonal itself. So, with
differences only of degree, it should have the same properties
as the force of which it is a special form, and particularly, the
same diffusion, the same aptitude for spreading itself contagiously
and the same ubiquity. But quite on the contrary, the soul is
voluntarily represented as a concrete, definite being, wholly
contained within itself and not communicable to others; it is
made the basis of our personality.</p>

<p>But this way of conceiving the soul is the product of a late and
philosophic elaboration. The popular representation, as it is
spontaneously formed from common experience, is very different,
especially at first. For the Australian, the soul is a very vague<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
thing, undecided and wavering in form, and spread over the
whole organism. Though it manifests itself especially at certain
points, there are probably none from which it is totally absent.
So it has a diffusion, a contagiousness and an omnipresence
comparable to those of the <i>mana</i>. Like the mana, it is able to
divide and duplicate itself infinitely, though remaining entire
in each of its parts; it is from these divisions and duplications
that the plurality of souls is derived. On the other hand, the
doctrine of reincarnation, whose generality we have established,
shows how many impersonal elements enter into the idea of the
soul and how essential those are. For if the same soul is going
to clothe a new personality in each generation, the individual
forms in which it successively develops itself must all be equally
external to it, and have nothing to do with its true nature. It
is a sort of generic substance which individualizes itself only
secondarily and superficially. Moreover, this conception of the
soul is by no means completely gone. The cult of relics shows
that for a host of believers even to-day, the soul of a saint,
with all its essential powers, continues to adhere to his different
bones; and this implies that he is believed to be able to diffuse
himself, subdivide himself and incorporate himself in all sorts
of different things simultaneously.</p>

<p>Just as the characteristic attributes of the mana are found
in the soul, so secondary and superficial changes are enough to
enable the mana to individualize itself in the form of a soul.
We pass from the first idea to the second with no break of continuity.
Every religious force which is attached in a special
way to a determined being participates in the characteristics
of this being, takes on its appearance and becomes its spiritual
double. Tregear, in his Maori-Polynesian dictionary, has thought
it possible to connect the word <i>mana</i> with another group of words,
such as <i>manawa</i>, <i>manamana</i>, etc., which seem to belong to
the same family, and which signify heart, life, consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
Is this not equivalent to saying that some sort of kinship ought
to exist between the corresponding ideas as well, that is to say,
between the idea of impersonal force and those of internal life,
mental force and, in a word, of the soul? This is why the question
whether the churinga is sacred because it serves as the residence
of a soul, as Spencer and Gillen believe, or because it has impersonal
virtues, as Strehlow thinks, seems to us to have little interest
and to be without sociological importance. Whether the efficacy
of a sacred object is represented in an abstract form in the mind
or is attributed to some personal agent does not really matter.
The psychological roots of both beliefs are identical: an object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is sacred because it inspires, in one way or another, a collective
sentiment of respect which removes it from profane touches.
In order to explain this sentiment, men sometimes fall back on
to a vague and imprecise cause, and sometimes on to a determined
spiritual being endowed with a name and a history; but these
different interpretations are superadded to one fundamental
phenomenon which is the same in both cases.</p>

<p>This, moreover, is what explains the singular confusions,
examples of which we have met with as we have progressed.
The individual, the soul of the ancestor which he reincarnates
or from which his own is an emanation, his churinga and the
animals of the totemic species are, as we have said, partially
equivalent and interchangeable things. This is because in certain
connections, they all affect the collective consciousness in the
same way. If the churinga is sacred, it is because of the collective
sentiments of respect inspired by the totemic emblem carved
upon its surface; now the same sentiment attaches itself to the
animals or plants whose outward form is reproduced by the
totem, to the soul of the individual, for it is thought of in the
form of the totemic being, and finally to the ancestral soul, of
which the preceding one is only a particular aspect. So all these
various objects, whether real or ideal, have one common element
by which they arouse a single affective state in the mind, and
through this, they become confused. In so far as they are
expressed by one and the same representation, they are indistinct.
This is how the Arunta has come to regard the churinga as the
body common to the individual, the ancestor and even the
totemic being. It is his way of expressing the identity of the
sentiments of which these different things are the object.</p>

<p>However, it does not follow from the fact the idea of the soul
is derived from the idea of mana that the first has a relatively
later origin, or that there was a period in history when men
were acquainted with religious forces only in their impersonal
forms. When some wish to designate by the word preanimist
an historical period during which animism was completely unknown,
they build up an arbitrary hypothesis;<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> for there is no
people among whom the ideas of the soul and of mana do not
coexist side by side. So there is no ground for imagining that
they were formed at two distinct times; everything, on the
contrary, goes to show that the two are coeval. Just as there is
no society without individuals, so those impersonal forces which
are disengaged from the group cannot establish themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
without incarnating themselves in the individual consciousnesses
where they individualize themselves. In reality, we do not
have two different developments, but two different aspects of
one and the same development. It is true that they do not
have an equal importance; one is more essential than the other.
The idea of mana does not presuppose the idea of the soul; for
if the mana is going to individualize itself and break itself up
into the particular souls, it must first of all exist, and what it is
in itself does not depend upon the forms it takes when individualized.
But on the contrary, the idea of the soul cannot be
understood except when taken in connection with the idea of
mana. So on this ground, it is possible to say that it is the result
of a secondary formation; but we are speaking of a secondary
formation in the logical, not the chronological, sense of the
word.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>But how does it come that men have believed that the soul
survives the body and is even able to do so for an indefinite
length of time?</p>

<p>From the analysis which we have made, it is evident that
the belief in immortality has not been established under the
influence of moral ideas. Men have not imagined the prolongation
of their existence beyond the tomb in order that a just retribution
for moral acts may be assured in another life, if it fails in this
one; for we have seen that all considerations of this sort are
foreign to the primitive conception of the beyond.</p>

<p>Nor is the other hypothesis any better, according to which
the other life was imagined as a means of escaping the agonizing
prospect of annihilation. In the first place, it is not true that
the need of personal survival was actively felt at the beginning.
The primitive generally accepts the idea of death with a sort of
indifference. Being trained to count his own individuality
for little, and being accustomed to exposing his life constantly,
he gives it up easily enough.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> More than that, the immortality
promised by the religions he practices is not personal. In a
large number of cases, the soul does not continue the personality
of the dead man, or does not continue it long, for, forgetful
of its previous existence, it goes away, after a while, to animate
another body and thus becomes the vivifying principle of a new
personality. Even among the most advanced peoples, it was
only a pale and sad existence that shades led in Sheol or Erebus,
and could hardly attenuate the regrets occasioned by the
memories of the life lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>A more satisfactory explanation is the one attaching the
conception of a posthumous life to the experiences of dreams.
Our dead friends and relatives reappear to us in dreams: we see
them act, we hear them speak; it is natural to conclude that
they continue to exist. But if these observations were able to
confirm the idea after it had once been born, they hardly seem
capable of creating it out of nothing. Dreams in which we see
departed persons living again are too rare and too short and
leave only too vague recollections of themselves, to have been
able to suggest so important a system of beliefs to men all by
themselves. There is a remarkable lack of proportion between
the effect and the cause to which it is attributed.</p>

<p>What makes this question embarrassing is the fact that in
itself, the idea of the soul does not imply that of its survival,
but rather seems to exclude it. In fact, we have seen that the
soul, though being distinguished from the body, is believed,
nevertheless, to be closely united to it: it ages along with
the body, it feels a reaction from all the maladies that fall upon
the body; so it would seem natural that it should die with the
body. At least, men ought to have believed that it ceased to
exist from the moment when it definitely lost its original form,
and when it was no longer what it had been. Yet it is at just
this moment that a new life opens out before it.</p>

<p>The myths which we have already described give the only
possible explanation of this belief. We have seen that the
souls of new-born children are either emanations of the ancestral
souls, or these souls themselves reincarnated. But in order that
they may either reincarnate themselves, or periodically give off
new emanations, they must have survived their first holders.
So it seems as though they admitted the survival of the dead in
order to explain the birth of the living. The primitive does not
have the idea of an all-powerful god who creates souls out of
nothing. It seems to him that souls cannot be made except out
of souls. So those who are born can only be new forms of those
who have been; consequently, it is necessary that these latter
continue to exist in order that others may be born. In fine,
the belief in the immortality of the soul is the only way in which
men were able to explain a fact which could not fail to attract
their attention; this fact is the perpetuity of the life of the group.
Individuals die, but the clan survives. So the forces which give
it life must have the same perpetuity. Now these forces are the
souls which animate individual bodies; for it is in them and
through them that the group is realized. For this reason, it is
necessary that they endure. It is even necessary that in enduring,
they remain always the same; for, as the clan always keeps its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
characteristic appearance, the spiritual substance out of which
it is made must be thought of as qualitatively invariable. Since
it is always the same clan with the same totemic principle, it is
necessary that the souls be the same, for souls are only the
totemic principle broken up and particularized. Thus there is
something like a germinative plasm, of a mystic order, which is
transmitted from generation to generation and which makes,
or at least is believed to make, the spiritual unity of the clan
through all time. And this belief, in spite of its symbolic character,
is not without a certain objective truth. For though the group
may not be immortal in the absolute sense of the word, still it is
true that it endures longer than the individuals and that it is
born and incarnated afresh in each new generation.</p>

<p>A fact confirms this interpretation. We have seen that
according to the testimony of Strehlow, the Arunta distinguish
two sorts of souls: on the one hand are those of the ancestors
of the Alcheringa, on the other, those of the individuals who
actually compose the active body of the tribe at each moment
in history. The second sort only survive the body for a relatively
short time; they are soon totally annihilated. Only the former
are immortal; as they are uncreated, so they do not perish.
It is also to be noticed that they are the only ones whose immortality
is necessary to explain the permanence of the group;
for it is upon them, and upon them alone, that it is incumbent to
assure the perpetuity of the clan, for every conception is their work.
In this connection, the others have no part to play. So souls are
not said to be immortal except in so far as this immortality is
useful in rendering intelligible the continuity of the collective life.</p>

<p>Thus the causes leading to the first beliefs in a future life had
no connections with the functions to be filled at a later period
by the institutions beyond the tomb. But when that had
once appeared, they were soon utilized for other purposes besides
those which had been their original reasons for existence. Even
in the Australian societies, we see them beginning to organize
themselves for this other purpose. Moreover, there was no need
of any fundamental transformation for this. How true it is
that the same social institution can successively fulfil different
functions without changing its nature!</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>The idea of the soul was for a long time, and still is in part,
the popular form of the idea of personality.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> So the genesis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of the former of these ideas should aid us in understanding how
the second one was formed.</p>

<p>From what has already been said, it is clear that the notion
of person is the product of two sorts of factors. One of these is
essentially impersonal: it is the spiritual principle serving as
the soul of the group. In fact, it is this which constitutes the
very substance of individual souls. Now this is not the possession
of any one in particular: it is a part of the collective patrimony;
in it and through it, all consciousnesses communicate. But on
the other hand, in order to have separate personalities, it is
necessary that another factor intervene to break up and differentiate
this principle: in other words, an individualizing factor
is necessary. It is the body that fulfils this function. As bodies
are distinct from each other, and as they occupy different points
of space and time, each of them forms a special centre about
which the collective representations reflect and colour themselves
differently. The result is that even if all the consciousnesses in
these bodies are directed towards the same world, to wit, the
world of the ideas and sentiments which brings about the moral
unity of the group, they do not all see it from the same angle;
each one expresses it in its own fashion.</p>

<p>Of these two equally indispensable factors, the former is
certainly not the less important, for this is the one which furnishes
the original matter for the idea of the soul. Perhaps some will be
surprised to see so considerable a r&ocirc;le attributed to the impersonal
element in the genesis of the idea of personality. But the philosophical
analysis of the idea of person, which has gone far ahead
of the sociological analysis, has reached analogous results on
this point. Among all the philosophers, Leibniz is one of those
who have felt most vividly what a personality is; for before
all, the nomad is a personal and autonomous being. Yet, for
Leibniz, the contents of all the monads is identical. In fact,
all are consciousnesses which express one and the same object,
the world; and as the world itself is only a system of representations,
each particular consciousness is really only the reflection
of the universal consciousness. However, each one
expresses it from its own point of view, and in its own manner.
We know how this difference of perspectives comes from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
fact that the monads are situated differently in relation to each
other and to the whole system which they constitute.</p>

<p>Kant expresses the same sentiment, though in a different
form. For him, the corner-stone of the personality is the will.
Now the will is the faculty of acting in conformity with reason,
and the reason is that which is most impersonal within us. For
reason is not my reason; it is human reason in general. It is
the power which the mind has of rising above the particular,
the contingent and the individual, to think in universal forms.
So from this point of view, we may say that what makes a man
a personality is that by which he is confounded with other
men, that which makes him a man, not a certain man. The
senses, the body and, in a word, all that individualizes, is, on
the contrary, considered as the antagonist of the personality by
Kant.</p>

<p>This is because individuation is not the essential characteristic
of the personality. A person is not merely a single subject
distinguished from all the others. It is especially a being to
which is attributed a relative autonomy in relation to the environment
with which it is most immediately in contact. It is represented
as capable of moving itself, to a certain degree: this is
what Leibniz expressed in an exaggerated way when he said
that the monad was completely closed to the outside. Now
our analysis permits us to see how this conception was formed
and to what it corresponds.</p>

<p>In fact, the soul, a symbolic representation of the personality,
has the same characteristic. Although closely bound to the
body, it is believed to be profoundly distinct from it and to
enjoy, in relation to it, a large degree of independence. During
life, it may leave it temporarily, and it definitely withdraws at
death. Far from being dependent upon the body, it dominates
it from the higher dignity which is in it. It may well take from
the body the outward form in which it individualizes itself, but
it owes nothing essential to it. Nor is the autonomy which all
peoples have attributed to the soul a pure illusion; we know
now what its objective foundation is. It is quite true that the
elements which serve to form the idea of the soul and those
which enter into the representation of the body come from two
different sources that are independent of one another. One sort
are made up of the images and impressions coming from all
parts of the organism; the others consist in the ideas and
sentiments which come from and express society. So the former
are not derived from the latter. There really is a part of ourselves
which is not placed in immediate dependence upon the
organic factor: this is all that which represents society in us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
The general ideas which religion or science fix in our minds,
the mental operations which these ideas suppose, the beliefs
and sentiments which are at the basis of our moral life, and all
these superior forms of psychical activity which society awakens
in us, these do not follow in the trail of our bodily states, as our
sensations and our general bodily consciousness do. As we
have already shown, this is because the world of representations
in which social life passes is superimposed upon its material
substratum, far from arising from it; the determinism which
reigns there is much more supple than the one whose roots
are in the constitution of our tissues and it leaves with the
actor a justified impression of the greatest liberty. The medium
in which we thus move is less opaque and less resistant: we feel
ourselves to be, and we are, more at our ease there. In a word,
the only way we have of freeing ourselves from physical forces
is to oppose them with collective forces.</p>

<p>But whatever we receive from society, we hold in common
with our companions. So it is not at all true that we are more
personal as we are more individualized. The two terms are
in no way synonymous: in one sense, they oppose more than
they imply one another. Passion individualizes, yet it also
enslaves. Our sensations are essentially individual; yet we
are more personal the more we are freed from our senses and
able to think and act with concepts. So those who insist upon all
the social elements of the individual do not mean by that to
deny or debase the personality. They merely refuse to confuse
it with the fact of individuation.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER IX</b><br /><br />

<small>THE IDEA OF SPIRITS AND GODS</small></h3>


<p>When we come to the idea of the soul, we have left the
circle of purely impersonal forces. But above the soul
the Australian religions already recognize mythical personalities
of a superior order: spirits, civilizing heroes and even gods who
are properly so-called. While it will be unnecessary to enter
into the detail of the mythologies, we must at least seek the form
in which these three categories of spiritual beings are presented
in Australia, and the way in which they are connected with the
whole religious system.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>A soul is not a spirit. In fact, it is shut up in a determined
organism; though it may leave it at certain moments, it is
ordinarily a prisoner there. It definitely escapes only at death,
and we have already seen the difficulties under which the separation
is accomplished. A spirit, on the contrary, though often
tied by the closest bonds to some particular object, such as a
spring, a rock, a tree, a star, etc., and though residing there by
preference, may go away at will and lead an independent existence
in free space. So it has a more extended circle of action.
It can act upon the individuals who approach it or whom it
approaches. The soul, on the contrary, has almost no influence
except over the body it animates; it is very exceptional that
it succeeds in influencing outside objects during the course of
its terrestrial life.</p>

<p>But if the soul does not have the distinctive characteristics of
the spirit, it acquires them, at least in part, at death. In fact,
when it has been disincarnated, so long as it does not descend
into a body again, it has the same liberty of movement as a
spirit. Of course, after the rites of mourning have been accomplished,
it is thought to go to the land of souls, but before this
it remains about the tomb for a rather long time. Also, even
after it has definitely departed, it is believed to prowl about in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the brush near the camp.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> It is generally represented as a
rather beneficent being, especially for the surviving members
of its family; we have seen that the soul of the father comes to
aid the growth of his children or his grandchildren. But it also
happens sometimes that it shows signs of a veritable cruelty;
everything depends upon its humour and the manner in which
it is treated by the living.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> So it is recommended, especially to
women and children, not to venture outside of the camp during
the night so as not to expose oneself to dangerous encounters.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>However, a ghost is not a real spirit. In the first place, it
generally has only a limited power of action; also, it does not
have a definite province. It is a vagabond, upon whom no
determined task is incumbent, for the effect of death has been
to put it outside of all regular forms; as regards the living, it
is a sort of a exile. A spirit, on the other hand, always has a
power of a certain sort and it is by this that it is defined; it is
set over a certain order of cosmic or social phenomena; it has
a more or less precise function to fulfil in the system of the
universe.</p>

<p>But there are some souls which satisfy this double condition
and which are consequently spirits, in the proper sense of the
word. These are the souls of the mythical personages whom
popular imagination has placed at the beginning of time, the
Altjirangamitjina or the men of the Alcheringa among the Arunta;
the Mura-mura among the tribes of Lake Eyre; the Muk-Kurnai
among the Kurnai, etc. In one sense, they are still souls, for
they are believed to have formerly animated bodies from which
they separated themselves at a certain moment. But even when
they led a terrestrial life, they already had, as we have seen,
exceptional powers; they had a mana superior to that of ordinary
men, and they have kept it. Also, they are charged with definite
functions.</p>

<p>In the first place, whether we accept the version of Spencer
and Gillen or that of Strehlow, it is to them that the care of
assuring the periodical recruiting of the clan falls. They have
charge of the phenomena of conception.</p>

<p>Even when the conception has been accomplished, the task
of the ancestor is not yet completed. It is his duty to guard
over the new-born child. Later, when the child has become a
man, he accompanies him in the hunt, brings game to him,
warns him by dreams of the dangers he may run, protects him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
against his enemies, etc. On this point, Strehlow is entirely in
accord with Spencer and Gillen.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> It is true that someone may
ask how it is possible, according to the version of these latter,
for the ancestor to fulfil this function; for, since he reincarnates
himself at the moment of conception, it seems as though he
should be confounded with the soul of the child and should
therefore be unable to protect it from without. But the fact is
that he does not reincarnate himself entirely; he merely duplicates
himself. One part of him enters the body of the woman
and fertilizes her; another part continues to exist outside and,
under the special name of Arumburinga, fulfils the office of
guardian genius.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see how great a kinship there is between this ancestral
spirit and the <i>genius</i> of the Latins or the
&#948;&#945;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957; of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
The identification of function is complete. In fact, at first
the genius is the one who begets, <i>qui gignit</i>; he expresses and
personifies the powers of generation.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> But at the same time,
he is the protector and director of the particular individual
to whose person he is attached.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> He is finally confused with
the personality itself of this individual; he represents the totality
of the proclivities and tendencies which characterize him and
give him a distinctive appearance among other men.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Hence
come the well-known expressions <i>indulgere genio</i>, <i>defraudere
genium</i> with the sense of <i>to follow one's natural temperament</i>.
At bottom, the <i>genius</i> is another form or double of the soul
of the individual. This is proved by the partial synonomy of
<i>genius</i> and <i>manes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> The manes is the genius after death; but
it is also all that survives of the dead man, that is to say, his
soul. In the same way, the soul of the Arunta and the ancestral
spirit which serves as his genius are only two different aspects
of one and the same being.</p>

<p>But it is not only in relation to persons that the ancestor
has a definite situation; he also has one in relation to things.
Though he is believed to have his real residence under the ground,
they think that he is always haunting the place where his nanja-tree
or rock is, or the water-hole which was spontaneously
formed at the exact spot where he disappeared into the ground,
having terminated his first existence. As this tree or rock is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
believed to represent the body of the hero, they imagine that
the soul itself is constantly coming back there, and lives there
more or less permanently; it is by the presence of this soul that
they explain the religious respect inspired by these localities.
No one can break the branch of a nanja-tree without a risk of
falling sick.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> "Formerly the act of breaking it down or injuring
it was punished with death. An animal or bird taking refuge
there could not be killed. Even the surrounding bushes had to
be respected: the grass could not be burned, the rocks also had
to be treated with respect. It was forbidden to remove them
or break them."<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> As this sacred character is attributed to the
ancestor, he appears as the spirit of this tree or rock, of this
water-hole or spring.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> If the spring is thought of as having some
connection with rain,<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> he will become a spirit of rain. Thus,
the same souls which serve as protecting geniuses for men also
fulfil cosmic functions at the same time. It is undoubtedly in
this sense that we must understand the text of Roth where he
says that in northern Queensland, the spirits of nature are the
souls of the dead who have chosen to live in the forests or caves.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>So we have here some spiritual beings that are different from
the wandering souls with no definite powers. Strehlow calls
them gods;<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> but this expression is inexact, at least in the
great majority of cases. If it were true, then in a society like
the Arunta where each one has his protecting ancestor, there
would be as many or more gods than there are individuals.
It would merely introduce confusion into our terminology to
give the name of god to a sacred being with only one worshipper.
It may be, of course, that the figure of the ancestor grows to
a point where it resembles a real divinity. Among the Warramunga,
as we have already pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> the clan as a whole
is thought to be descended from one sole and unique ancestor.
It is easily seen how this collective ancestor might, under certain
circumstances, become the object of a collective devotion. To
choose a notable example, this is what has happened to the
snake Wollunqua.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> This mythical beast, from whom the clan
of the same name is held to be descended, continues to live,
they believe, in water-holes which are therefore surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
with a religious respect. Thus it becomes the object of a cult
which the clan celebrates collectively: through determined
rites, they attempt to please him and to win his favours, and
they address to him all sorts of prayers, etc. So we may say
that he is like a god of the clan. But this is a very exceptional
case, or even, according to Spencer and Gillen, a unique one.
Normally, the word "spirits" is the only one suitable for designating
these ancestral personages.</p>

<p>As to the manner in which this conception has been formed,
we may say that it is evident from what has preceded.</p>

<p>As we have already shown, the existence of individual souls,
when once admitted, cannot be understood unless one imagines
an original supply of fundamental souls at the origin of things,
from which all the others were derived. Now these architype
souls had to be conceived as containing within them the source
of all religious efficacy; for, since the imagination does not go
beyond them, it is from them and only from them that all sacred
things are believed to come, both the instruments of the cult,
the members of the clan and the animals of the totemic species.
They incarnate all the sacredness diffused in the whole tribe
and the whole world, and so they are attributed powers noticeably
superior to those enjoyed by the simple souls of men. Moreover,
time by itself increases and reinforces the sacred character of
things. A very ancient churinga inspires much more respect
than a new one, and is supposed to have more virtues.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> The
sentiments of veneration of which it has been the object during
the series of successive generations who have handled it are,
as it were, accumulated in it. For the same reason, the personages
who for centuries have been the subject of myths respectfully
passed on from mouth to mouth, and periodically put into action
by the rites, could not fail to take a very especial place in the
popular imagination.</p>

<p>But how does it happen that, instead of remaining outside
of the organized society, they have become regular members of
it?</p>

<p>This is because each individual is the double of an ancestor.
Now when two beings are related as closely as this, they are
naturally conceived as incorporated together; since they participate
in the same nature, it seems as though that which affects
one ought to affect the other as well. Thus the group of mythical
ancestors became attached to the society of the living; the same
interests and the same passions were attributed to each; they
were regarded as associates. However, as the former had a
higher dignity than the latter, this association takes, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
public mind, the form of an agreement between superiors and
inferiors, between patrons and clients, benefactors and recipients.
Thus comes this curious idea of a protecting genius who is
attached to each individual.</p>

<p>The question of how this ancestor came to have relations
not only with men, but also with things, may appear more
embarrassing; for, at the first glance, we do not see what connection
there can be between a personage of this sort and a
rock or tree. But a fact which we owe to Strehlow furnishes us
with a solution of this problem, which is at least probable.</p>

<p>These trees and rocks are not situated at any point in the
tribal territory, but, for the most part, they are grouped around
the sanctuaries, called ertnatulunga by Spencer and Gillen and
arknanaua by Strehlow, where the churinga of the clan is kept.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
We know the respect with which these localities are enhaloed
from the mere fact that the most precious instruments of the
cult are there. Each of these spreads sanctity all about it.
It is for this reason that the neighbouring trees and rocks appear
sacred, that it is forbidden to destroy or harm them, and that all
violence used against them is a sacrilege. This sacred character
is really due to a simple phenomenon of psychic contagiousness;
but in order to explain it, the native must admit that these
different objects have relations with the different beings in
whom he sees the source of all religious power, that is to say,
with the ancestors of the Alcheringa. Hence comes the system
of myths of which we have spoken. They imagined that each
ertnatulunga marked the spot where a group of ancestors entered
into the ground. The mounds or trees which covered the ground
were believed to represent their bodies. But as the soul retains,
in a general way, a sort of affinity for the body in which it dwelt,
they were naturally led to believe that these ancestral souls
continued to frequent these places where their material envelope
remained. So they were located in the rocks, the trees or the
water-holes. Thus each of them, though remaining attached to
some determined individual, became transformed into a sort of
<i>genius loci</i> and fulfilled its functions.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>The conceptions thus elucidated enable us to understand
a form of totemism which we have left unexplained up to the
present: this is individual totemism.</p>

<p>An individual totem is defined, in its essence, by the two
following characteristics: (1) it is a being in an animal or vegetable
form whose function is to protect an individual; (2) the
fate of this individual and that of his patron are closely united:
all that touches the latter is sympathetically communicated to
the former. Now the ancestral spirits of which we have just
been speaking answer to this same definition. They also belong,
at least in part, to the animal or vegetable kingdoms. They,
too, are protecting geniuses. Finally, a sympathetic bond unites
each individual to his protecting ancestor. In fact, the nanja-tree,
representing the mystical body of this ancestor, cannot be
destroyed without the man's feeling himself menaced. It is
true that this belief is losing its force to-day, but Spencer and
Gillen have observed it, and in any case, they are of the opinion
that formerly it was quite general.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The identity of these two conceptions is found even in their
details.</p>

<p>The ancestral souls reside in trees or rocks which are considered
sacred. Likewise, among the Euahlayi, the spirit of the animal
serving as individual totem is believed to inhabit a tree or stone.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>
This tree or stone is sacred; no one may touch it except the
proprietor of the totem; when it is a stone or rock, this interdiction
is still absolute.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The result is that they are veritable
places of refuge.</p>

<p>Finally, we have seen that the individual soul is only another
aspect of the ancestral spirit, according to Strehlow, this serves
after a fashion, as a second self.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Likewise, following an expression
of Mrs. Parker, the individual totem of the Euahlayi, called
Yunbeai, is the <i>alter ego</i> of the individual: "The soul of a man
is in his Yunbeai and the soul of his Yunbeai is in him."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> So at
bottom, it is one soul in two bodies. The kinship of these two
notions is so close that they are sometimes expressed by one
and the same word. This is the case in Melanesia and in Polynesia:
<i>atai</i> in the island Mota, <i>tamaniu</i> in the island Aurora,
and <i>talegia</i> in Motlaw all designate both the soul of the individual
and his personal totem.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> It is the same with <i>aitu</i> in Samoa.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
This is because the individual totem is merely the outward and
visible form of the ego or the personality, of which the soul is
the inward and invisible form.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p>Thus the individual totem has all the essential characteristics
of the protecting ancestor and fills the same r&ocirc;le: this is because
it has the same origin and proceeds from the same idea.</p>

<p>Each of them, in fact, consists in a duplication of the soul.
The totem, as the ancestor, is the soul of the individual, but
externalized and invested with powers superior to those it is
believed to possess while within the organism. Now this duplication
is the result of a psychological necessity; for it only expresses
the nature of the soul which, as we have seen, is double. In one
sense, it is ours: it expresses our personality. But at the same
time, it is outside of us, for it is only the reaching into us of a
religious force which is outside of us. We cannot confound
ourselves with it completely, for we attribute to it an excellence
and a dignity by which it rises far above us and our empirical
individuality. So there is a whole part of ourselves which we
tend to project into the outside. This way of thinking of ourselves
is so well established in our nature that we cannot escape
it, even when we attempt to regard ourselves without having
recourse to any religious symbols. Our moral consciousness is
like a nucleus about which the idea of the soul forms itself; yet
when it speaks to us, it gives the effect of an outside power,
superior to us, which gives us our law and judges us, but which
also aids and sustains us. When we have it on our side, we
feel ourselves to be stronger against the trials of life, and better
assured of triumphing over them, just as the Australian who,
when trusting in his ancestor or his personal totem, feels himself
more valiant against his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> So there is something objective
at the basis of these conceptions, whether we have in mind
the Roman <i>genius</i>, the individual totem, or the Alcheringa
ancestor; and this is why they have survived, in various forms,
up to the present day. Everything goes just as if we really had
two souls; one which is within us, or rather, which is us; the
other which is above us, and whose function it is to control and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
assist the first one. Frazer thought that the individual totem was
an external soul; but he believed that this exteriority was the
result of an artifice and a magic ruse. In reality, it is implied
in the very constitution of the idea of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The spirits of which we have just been speaking are essentially
benefactors. Of course they punish a man if he does not treat
them in a fitting manner;<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> but it is not their function to work
evil.</p>

<p>However, a spirit is in itself just as capable of doing evil
as good. This is why we find a class of evil geniuses forming
itself naturally, in opposition to these auxiliary and protecting
spirits, which enables men to explain the permanent evils that
they have to suffer, their nightmares<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> and illnesses,<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> whirlwinds
and tempests,<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> etc. Of course this is not saying that all these
human miseries have appeared as things too abnormal to be
explained in any way except by supernatural forces; but it is
saying that these forces are thought of under a religious form.
As it is a religious principle which is considered the source of
life, so, all the events which disturb or destroy life ought logically
to be traced to a principle of the same sort.</p>

<p>These harmful spirits seem to have been conceived on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
same model as the good spirits of which we have just been
speaking. They are represented in an animal form, or one that
is half-animal, half-man;<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> but men are naturally inclined to
give them enormous dimensions and a repulsive aspect.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> Like
the souls of the ancestors, they are believed to inhabit trees,
rocks, water-holes and subterranean caverns.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> Taking the
Arunta as a particular example, Spencer and Gillen say expressly
that these evil geniuses, known under the name of Oruncha,
are beings of the Alcheringa.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> Many are represented as the
souls of persons who had led a terrestrial life.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Among the
personages of the fabulous epoch, there were, in fact, many
different temperaments: some had cruel and evil instincts which
they retained;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> others were naturally of a bad constitution;
they were thin and emaciated; so after they had entered into
the ground, the nanja rocks to which they gave birth were considered
the homes of dangerous influences.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>Yet they are distinguished by special characteristics from
their confr&egrave;res, the heroes of the Alcheringa. They do not
reincarnate themselves; among living men, there is no one who
represents them; they are without human posterity.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> When,
judging from certain signs, they believe that a child is the
result of their work, it is put to death as soon as born.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Also,
these belong to no determined totemic group; they are outside
the social organization.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> By all these traits, they are recognized
as magic powers rather than religious ones. And in fact, it is
especially with the magician that they have relations; very
frequently it is from them that he gets his powers.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> So we
have now arrived at the point where the world of religion
stops and that of magic commences; and as this latter is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
outside the field of our research, we need not push our researches
further.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The appearance of the notion of spirits marks an important
step in advance in the individualization of religious forces.</p>

<p>However, the spiritual beings of whom we have been speaking
up to the present are as yet only secondary personages. They
are either evil-working geniuses who belong to magic rather
than religion, or else, being attached to determined individuals
or places, they cannot make their influence felt except within a
circle of a very limited radius. So they can only be the objects
of private and local rites. But after the idea has once been
established, it naturally spreads to the higher spheres of the
religious life, and thus mythical personalities of a superior order
are born.</p>

<p>Though the ceremonies of the different clans differ from one
another, they all belong to the same religion, none the less; also,
a certain number of essential similarities exist between them.
Since all the clans are only parts of one and the same tribe, the
unity of the tribe cannot fail to make itself felt through this
diversity of particular cults. In fact, there is no totemic group
that does not have churinga and bull-roarers, and these are used
everywhere in the same way. The organization of the tribe
into phratries, matrimonial classes and clans, and the exogamic
interdictions attached to them, are veritable tribal institutions.
The initiation celebrations all include certain fundamental
practices, the extraction of a tooth, circumcision, subincision,
etc., which do not vary with the totems within a single tribe.
The uniformity on this point is the more easily established
as the initiation always takes place in the presence of the tribe,
or at least, before an assembly to which the different clans have
been summoned. The reason for this is that the object of the
initiation is to introduce the neophyte into the religious life,
not merely of the clan into which he was born, but of the tribe
as a whole; so it is necessary that the various aspects of the
tribal religion be represented before him and take place, in a
way, under his very eyes. It is on this occasion that the moral
and religious unity of the tribe is affirmed the best.</p>

<p>Thus, in each society there are a certain number of rites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
which are distinguished from all the others by their homogeneity
and their generality. So noticeably a harmony seemed to be
explicable only by a unity of origin. So they imagined that
each group of similar rites had been founded by one and the same
ancestor, who came to reveal them to the tribe as a whole. Thus,
among the Arunta, it was an ancestor of the Wild Cat clan,
named Putiaputia,<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> who is thought to have taught men the way
of making churinga and using it ritually; among the Warramunga,
it was Murtu-murtu;<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> among the Urabunna, Witurna;<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>
it was Atnatu among the Kaitish<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> and Tendun among the
Kurnai.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Likewise, the practice of circumcision is attributed
by the eastern Dieri and many other tribes<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> to two special
Muramura, and by the Arunta to a hero of the Alcheringa, of
the Lizard totem, named Mangarkunjerkunja.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> To this same
personage are ascribed the foundation of the matrimonial institutions
and the social organization they imply, the discovery
of fire, the invention of the spear, the buckler, the boomerang,
etc. It also happens very frequently that the inventor of the
bull-roarer is also considered the founder of the rites of initiation.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>These special ancestors cannot be put in the same rank as
the others. On the one hand, the sentiments of veneration
which they inspire are not limited to one clan, but are common
to the whole tribe. On the other hand, it is to them that men
ascribe all that is most esteemed in the tribal civilization. For
this double reason, they became the object of a special consideration.
For example, they say of Atnatu that he was born
in heaven at an epoch even prior to the times of the Alcheringa,
that he made himself and that he gave himself the name he
bears. The stars are his wives and daughters. Beyond the
heaven where he lives, there is another one with another sun.
His name is sacred, and should never be pronounced before
women or non-initiated persons.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, howsoever great the prestige enjoyed by these personages
may be, there was no occasion for founding special rites in their
honour; for they themselves are only rites personified. They
have no other reason for existence than to explain existing
practices; they are only another aspect of these. The churinga
and the ancestor who invented it are only one; sometimes,
both have the same name.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> When someone makes the bull-roarer
resound, they say that it is the voice of the ancestor
making himself heard.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> But, for the very reason that each
of these heroes is confounded with the cult he is believed to
have founded, they believe that he is attentive to the way in
which it is celebrated. He is not satisfied unless the worshippers
fulfil their duties exactly; he punishes those who are negligent.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>
So he is thought of as the guardian of the rite, as well as its
founder, and for this reason, he becomes invested with a veritable
moral r&ocirc;le.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>However, this mythological formation is not the highest which
is to be found among the Australians. There are at least a
certain number of tribes who have arrived at a conception
of a god who, if not unique, is at least supreme, and to whom
is attributed a pre-eminent position among all the other religious
entities.</p>

<p>The existence of this belief was pointed out long ago by
different observers;<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> but it is Howitt who has contributed the
most to establishing its relative generality. In fact, he has
verified it over a very extended geographical area embracing
the State of Victoria and New South Wales and even extending
up to Queensland.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> In all this entire region, a considerable
number of tribes believe in the existence of a veritable tribal
divinity, who has different names, according to the district. The
ones most frequently employed are Bunjil or Punjil,<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> Daramulun<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
and Baiame.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> But we also find Nuralie or Nurelle,<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> Kohin<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>
and Mangan-ngaua.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> The same conception is found again
farther west, among the Narrinyeri, where the great god is called
Nurunderi or Ngurrunderi.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> Among the Dieri, it is probable
that there is one of the Mura-mura, or ordinary ancestors, who
enjoys a sort of supremacy over the others.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> Finally, in opposition
to the affirmations of Spencer and Gillen, who declare
that they have observed no belief in a real divinity among the
Arunta,<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> Strehlow assures us that this people, as well as the
Loritja, recognize, under the name Altjira, a veritable "good
god."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>The essential characteristics of this personage are the same
everywhere. It is an immortal, and even an eternal being,
for it was not derived from any other. After having lived on
earth for a certain length of time, he ascended to heaven, or
else was taken up there,<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> and continues to live there, surrounded
by his family, for generally he is said to have one or several wives,
children and brothers,<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> who sometimes assist him in his functions.
Under the pretext of a visit he is said to have made to them,
he and his family are frequently identified with certain stars.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Moreover, they attribute to him a power over stars. It is he
who regulates the journey of the sun and moon;<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> he gives them
orders.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> It is he who makes the lightning leap from the clouds
and who throws the thunder-bolts.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> Since he is the thunder,
he is also connected with the rain:<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> it is to him that men address
themselves when there is a scarcity of water, or when too much
falls.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p>They speak of him as a sort of creator: he is called the father
of men and they say that he made them. According to a legend
current around Melbourne, Bunjil made the first man in the
following manner. He made a little statue out of white clay;
then, after he had danced all around it several times and had
breathed into its nostrils, the statue became animated and
commenced to walk about.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> According to another myth, he
lighted the sun; thus the earth became heated and men came
out of it.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> At the same time that he made men,<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> this divine
personage made the animals and trees;<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> it is to him that
men owe all the arts of life, arms, language and tribal rites.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
He is the benefactor of humanity. Even yet, he plays the r&ocirc;le
of a sort of providence for them. It is he who supplies his worshippers
with all that is necessary for their existence.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> He is
in communication with them, either directly or through intermediaries.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
But being at the same time guardian of the morals
of the tribe, he treats them severely when these are violated.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>
If we are to believe certain observers, he will even fulfil the
office of judge, after this life; he will separate the good from
the bad, and will not reward the ones like the others.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> In any
case, they are often represented as ruling the land of the dead,<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>
and as gathering the souls together when they arrive in the
beyond.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>As the initiation is the principal form of the tribal cult, it is
to the rites of initiation that he is attached especially; he is
their centre. He is very frequently represented by an image
cut on a piece of bark or soaked into the ground. They dance
around it; they sing in its honour; they even address real
prayers to it.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> They explain to the young men who the personage
is whom this image represents; they tell them his secret name,
which the women and the uninitiated cannot know; they relate
to them his history and the part attributed to him in the life of
the tribe. At other times they raise their hands towards the
heaven where he is thought to dwell, or else they point their
arms or the ritual instruments they have in hand in this direction;<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
this is a way of entering into communication with him. They
feel his presence everywhere. He watches over the neophyte
when he has withdrawn into the forest.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> He is attentive to the
manner in which the ceremonies are celebrated. The initiation
is his cult. So he gives special attention to seeing that these
are carried out exactly: if there are any faults or negligences,
he punishes them in a terrible manner.<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the authority of each of these supreme gods is not
limited to a single tribe; it is recognized equally by a number
of neighbouring tribes. Bunjil is adored in nearly all of Victoria,
Baiame in a considerable portion of New South Wales, etc.;
this is why there are so few gods for a relatively extended
geographical area. So the cults of which they are the object have
an international character. It even happens sometimes that
mythologies intermingle, combine and make mutual borrowings.
Thus the majority of the tribes who believe in Baiame also admit
the existence of Daramulun; however, they accord him a slighter
dignity. They make him a son or brother of Baiame, and subordinate
to this latter.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> Thus the faith in Daramulun has spread
in diverse forms, into all of New South Wales. So it is far from
true that religious internationalism is a peculiarity of the most
recent and advanced religions. From the dawn of history,
religious beliefs have manifested a tendency to overflow out of
one strictly limited political society; it is as though they had
a natural aptitude for crossing frontiers, and for diffusing and
internationalizing themselves. Of course there have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>peoples and times when this spontaneous aptitude has been held
in check by opposed social necessities; but that does not keep
it from being real and, as we see, very primitive.</p>

<p>To Tylor this conception has appeared to be a part of so
elevated a theology that he refuses to see in it anything but the
product of a European importation: he would have it be a more
or less denatured Christian idea.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> Andrew Lang, on the contrary,
considers them autochthonous;<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> but as he also admits that it
is contrasted with all the other Australian beliefs and rests on
completely different principles, he concludes that the religions
of Australia are made up of two heterogeneous systems, superimposed
one upon the other, and consequently derived from a
double origin. On the one hand, there were ideas relative to
totems and spirits, which had been suggested to men by the
sight of certain natural phenomena. But at the same time, by
a sort of intuition as to the nature of which he refuses to make
himself clear,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> the human intelligence succeeded at the first
onset in conceiving a unique god, creator of the world and
legislator of the moral order. Lang even estimates that this
idea was purer of foreign elements at the beginning, and especially
in Australia, than in the civilizations which immediately followed.
With time, it was covered over and obscured little by little by the
ever-growing mass of animistic and totemic superstitions. Thus
it underwent a sort of progressive degeneration up to the day
when, as the effect of a privileged culture, it succeeded in coming
into its own and restated itself again with more force and clarity
than it had in the first place.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>But the facts allow neither the sceptical hypothesis of Tylor
nor the theological interpretation of Lang.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is certain to-day that the ideas relative
to the great tribal god are of indigenous origin. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
observed before the influence of the missionaries had as yet
had time to make itself felt.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> But it does not follow that it is
necessary to attribute them to a mysterious revelation. Far
from being derived from a different source than the regular
totemic beliefs, they are, on the contrary, only the logical working-out
of these beliefs and their highest form.</p>

<p>We have already seen how the notion of mythical ancestors
is implied in the very principles upon which totemism rests,
for each of them is a totemic being. Now, though the great gods
are certainly superior to these, still, there are only differences
of degree between them; we pass from the first to the second
with no break of continuity. In fact, a great god is himself an
ancestor of especial importance. They frequently speak to us
about him as though he were a man, endowed, to be sure, with
more than human powers, but one who lived a human life upon
the earth.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> He is pictured as a great hunter,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> a powerful magician,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>
or the founder of the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> He was the first man.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> One legend
even represents him in the form of a worn-out old man who
could hardly move about.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> If a supreme god named Mura-mura
has existed among the Dieri, the very word is significant, for it
serves to designate the class of the ancestors. Likewise, Nuralie,
the name of a great god among the tribes on the Murray River,
is sometimes used as a collective expression which is applied to
the group of mythical beings whom tradition places at the origin
of things.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> They are personages wholly comparable to those
of the Alcheringa.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> In Queensland, we have already met with
a god Anjea or Anjir, who made men but who seems, nevertheless,
to be only the first man.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>A fact that has aided Australian thought to pass from the
numerous ancestral geniuses to the idea of the tribal god is that
between the two extremes a middle term has been inserted,
which has served as a transition: these are the civilizing heroes.
The fabulous beings whom we call by this name are really simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
ancestors to whom mythology has attributed an eminent place
in the history of the tribe, and whom it has, for this reason, set
above the others. We have even seen that they ordinarily form
a part of the totemic organization: Mangarkunjerkunja belongs
to the Lizard totem and Putiaputia to the Wild Cat totem.
But on the other hand, the functions which they are believed
to fulfil, or to have fulfilled, are closely similar to those incumbent
upon a great god. He, too, is believed to have introduced the
arts of civilization among men, to have been the founder of the
principal social institutions and the revealer of the great religious
ceremonies which still remain under his control. If he is the
father of men, it is because he manufactured them rather than
begat them: but Mangarkunjerkunja also made them. Before
his time, there were no men, but only unformed masses of flesh,
in which the different members and even the different individuals
were not yet separated from one another. It was he who cut
up this original matter and made real human beings out of it.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>
Between this mode of fabrication and the one the myth we
have spoken of attributes to Bunjil, there are only shades of
difference. Moreover, the bonds uniting these two sorts of
figures to each other are well shown by the fact that a relationship
of descent is sometimes established between them. Among
the Kurnai, the hero of the bull-roarer, Tundun, is the son of
the great god Mungan-ngaua.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> Likewise, among the Euahlayi,
Daramulun, the son or brother of Baiame, is identical with
Gayandi who is the equivalent of the Tundun of the Kurnai.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
Of course it is not necessary to conclude from these facts that
the great god is nothing more than a civilizing hero. There are
cases where these two personages are carefully differentiated.
But if they are not confounded, they are at least relatives.
So it sometimes happens that we find it hard to distinguish
them; there are some who could be classified equally well in
one category or the other. Thus, we have spoken of Atnatu
as a civilizing hero; but he comes very near to being a great
god.</p>

<p>The notion of a supreme god even depends so closely upon
the entire system of the totemic beliefs that it still bears their
mark. Tundun is a divine hero, as we have just seen, who is
very close to the tribal divinity; now among the Kurnai, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
same word means totem.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> Similarly, among the Arunta, Altjira
is the name of a great god; it is also the name of the maternal
totem.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> But there is more to be said than this; many great
gods have an obviously totemic aspect. Daramulun is an eagle-hawk;<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>
his mother, an emu.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> It is also under the features of
an emu that Baiame is represented.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> The Altjira of the Arunta
has the legs of an emu.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Before being the name of a great god,
Nuralie designated, as we just saw, the ancestor-founders of
the tribe; now some of these were crows, the others hawks.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>
According to Howitt,<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> Bunjil is always represented in a human
form; however, the same word serves to designate the totem
of a phratry, the eagle-hawk. At least one of his sons is among
the totems included in the phratry to which he has given, or from
which he has taken his name.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> His brother is Pallyan, the
bat; now this latter serves as sexual totem for the men in
many tribes in Victoria.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>We can even go farther and state more definitely the connection
which these great gods have with the totemic system.
We have just seen that Bunjil is the totem of a phratry. Daramulun,
like Bunjil, is an eagle-hawk, and we know that this bird
is the totem of phratries in a large number of south-eastern
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> We have already pointed out that Nuralie seems to
have originally been a collective term designating indistinctly
either eagle-hawks or crows; now in the tribes where this myth
has been observed, the crow is the totem of one of the two phratries,
the eagle-hawk, that of the other.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Also, the legendary
history of the great gods resembles that of the totems of the
phratries very closely. The myths, and sometimes the rites,
commemorate the struggles which each of these divinities fought
against a carnivorous bird, over which it triumphed only with
the greatest difficulty. Bunjil, the first man, after making the
second man, Karween, entered into a conflict with him, and in
the course of a sort of duel, he wounded him severely and changed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
him into a crow.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> The two species of Nurtalie are represented
as two hostile groups which were originally in a constant state
of war.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Baiame, on his side, had to fight against Mullian, the
cannibal eagle-hawk, who, by the way, is identical with Daramulun.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>
Now, as we have seen, there is also a sort of constitutional
hostility between the totems of the phratries. This
parallelism completes the proof that the mythology of the great
gods and that of these totems are closely related. This relationship
will appear still more evident if we notice that the rival of
the god is regularly either a crow or an eagle-hawk, and that
these are quite generally the totems of the phratries.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>So Baiame, Daramulun, Nuralie and Bunjil seem to be phratry-totems
who have been deified; and we may imagine that this
apotheosis took place as follows. It is obviously in the assemblies
which take place in regard to the initiation that the conception
was elaborated, for the great gods do not play a r&ocirc;le of any
importance except in these rites, and are strangers to the other
religious ceremonies. Moreover, as the initiation is the principal
form of the tribal cult, it is only on this occasion that a tribal
mythology could arise. We have already seen how the rituals
of circumcision and subincision spontaneously tend to personify
themselves under the form of civilizing heroes. However, these
heroes exercised no supremacy; they were on the same footing
as the other legendary benefactors of society. But wherever
the tribe acquired a livelier sentiment of itself, this sentiment
naturally incarnated itself in some personage, who became
its symbol. In order to account for the bonds uniting them to
one another, no matter what clan they belonged to, men imagined
that they were all descended from the same stock and that they
were all descended from a single father, to whom they owe their
existence, though he owed his to no one. The god of the initiation
was predestined to this r&ocirc;le, for, according to an expression
frequently coming to the lips of the natives, the object of the
initiation is to make or manufacture men. So they attributed
a creative power to this god, and for all these reasons, he found
himself invested with a prestige setting him well above the
other heroes of the mythology. These others became his auxiliaries,
subordinate to him; they were made his sons or younger
brothers, as was the case with Tundun, Gayandi, Karween,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Pallyan, etc. But other sacred beings already existed, who
occupied an equally eminent place in the religious system of
the clan: these were the totems of the phratries. Wherever
these are maintained, they are believed to keep the totems
of the clans dependent upon them. Thus they had all that was
necessary for becoming tribal divinities themselves. So it was
only natural that a partial confusion should arise between these
two sorts of mythical beings; it is thus that one of the two
fundamental totems of the tribe gave his traits to the great god.
But as it was necessary to explain why only one of them was
called to this dignity and the other excluded, they supposed
that this latter, in the course of a fight against his rival, was
vanquished and that his exclusion was the consequence of his
defeat. This theory was the more readily admitted because it
was in accord with the rest of the mythology, where the totems
of the phratries are generally considered enemies of one another.</p>

<p>A myth observed by Mrs. Parker among the Euahlayi<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> may
serve to confirm this explanation, for it merely translates it
into figurative language. It is related that in this tribe, the
totems were only the names given to the different parts of
Baiame's body at first. So the clans were, in a sense, the fragments
of the divine body. Now is this not just another way of
saying that the great god is the synthesis of all the totems and
consequently the personification of the tribal unity?</p>

<p>But at the same time, it takes an international character.
In fact, the members of the tribe to which the young initiates
belong are not the only ones who assist at the ceremonies of
initiation; representatives from the neighbouring tribes are
specially summoned to these celebrations, which thus become
sorts of international fairs, at once religious and laical.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Beliefs
elaborated in social environments thus constituted could not
remain the exclusive patrimony of any special nationality.
The stranger to whom they are revealed carries them back to
his own tribe when he returns home; and as, sooner or later,
he is forced to invite his former hosts, there is a continual exchange
of ideas from tribe to tribe. It is thus that an international
mythology was established, of which the great god was quite
naturally the essential element, for it had its origin in the rites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of initiation which it is his function to personify. So his name
passed from one language to another, along with the representations
which were attached to it. The fact that the names of the
phratries are generally the same in very different tribes could
not fail to facilitate this diffusion. The internationalism of the
totems opened the way for that of the great god.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>We thus reach the highest conception to which totemism
has arrived. This is the point where it touches and prepares
the religions which are to follow, and aids us in understanding
them. But at the same time, we are able to see that this culminating
idea is united without any interruption to the crudest
beliefs which we analysed to start with.</p>

<p>In fact, the great tribal god is only an ancestral spirit who
finally won a pre-eminent place. The ancestral spirits are only
entities forged in the image of the individual souls whose origin
they are destined to explain. The souls, in their turn, are only
the form taken by the impersonal forces which we found at the
basis of totemism, as they individualize themselves in the human
body. The unity of the system is as great as its complexity.</p>

<p>In this work of elaboration, the idea of the soul has undoubtedly
played an important part: it is through it that the idea of
personality has been introduced into the domain of religion.
But it is not true that, as the theorists of animism maintain,
it contains the germ of the whole religion. First of all, it presupposes
the notion of <i>mana</i> or the totemic principle of which
it is only a special form. Then, if the spirits and gods could
not be conceived before the soul, they are, nevertheless, more
than mere human souls, liberated by death; else whence would
come their supernatural powers? The idea of the soul has
merely served to direct the mythological imagination in a new
way and to suggest to it constructions of a new sort. But the
matter for these conceptions has been taken, not from the
representation of the soul, but from this reservoir of the anonymous
and diffused forces which constitute the original foundation
of religions. The creation of mythical personalities has only
been another way of thinking of these essential forces.</p>

<p>As for the notion of the great god, it is due entirely to the
sentiment whose action we have already observed in the genesis
of the most specifically totemic beliefs: this is the tribal sentiment.
In fact, we have seen that totemism was not the work of
isolated clans, but that it was always elaborated in the body of
a tribe which was to some degree conscious of its unity. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
for this reason that the different cults peculiar to each clan
mutually touch and complete each other in such a way as to
form a unified whole.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Now it is this same sentiment of a tribal
unity which is expressed in the conception of a supreme god,
common to the tribe as a whole. So they are quite the same
causes which are active at the bottom and at the top of this
religious system.</p>

<p>However, up to the present, we have considered the religious
representations as if they were self-sufficient and could be explained
by themselves. But in reality, they are inseparable
from the rites, not only because they manifest themselves there,
but also because they, in their turn, feel the influence of these.
Of course the cult depends upon the beliefs, but it also reacts
upon them. So in order to understand them better, it is important
to understand it better. The moment has come for
undertaking its study.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER I</b><br /><br />

<small>THE NEGATIVE CULT AND ITS FUNCTIONS
THE ASCETIC RITES</small></h3>


<p>We do not have the intention of attempting a complete
description of the primitive cult in what is to follow.
Being preoccupied especially with reaching that which is most
elementary and most fundamental in the religious life, we shall
not attempt to reconstruct in detail the frequently confused
multiplicity of all the ritual forms. But out of the midst of this
extreme diversity of practices we should like to touch upon the
most characteristic attitudes which the primitive observes in the
celebration of his cult, to classify the most general forms of his
rites, and to determine their origins and significance, in order
that we may control and, if there is occasion, make more definite
the results to which the analysis of the beliefs has led us.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>Every cult presents a double aspect, one negative, the other
positive. In reality, of course, the two sorts of rites which we
denominate thus are closely associated; we shall see that they
suppose one another. But still, they are different and, if it is
only to understand their connection, it is necessary to distinguish
them.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>By definition, sacred beings are separated beings. That which
characterizes them is that there is a break of continuity between
them and the profane beings. Normally, the first are outside
the others. A whole group of rites has the object of realizing
this state of separation which is essential. Since their function
is to prevent undue mixings and to keep one of these two domains
from encroaching upon the other, they are only able to impose
abstentions or negative acts. Therefore, we propose to give the
name negative cult to the system formed by these special rites.
They do not prescribe certain acts to the faithful, but confine
themselves to forbidding certain ways of acting; so they all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
take the form of interdictions, or as is commonly said by ethnographers,
of <i>taboos</i>. This latter word is the one used in the
Polynesian languages to designate the institution in virtue of
which certain things are withdrawn from common use<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>; it is
also an adjective expressing the distinctive characteristic of
these kinds of things. We have already had occasion to show
how hard it is to translate a strictly local and dialectical expression
like this into a generic term. There is no religion where there
are no interdictions and where they do not play a considerable
part; so it is regrettable that the consecrated terminology should
seem to make so universal an institution into a peculiarity of
Polynesia.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> The expression <i>interdicts</i> or <i>interdictions</i> seems to
us to be much more preferable. However, the word taboo, like
the word totem, is so customary that it would show an excess of
purism to prohibit it systematically; also, the inconveniences
it may have are attenuated when its real meaning and importance
have once been definitely stated.</p>

<p>But there are interdictions of different sorts which it is important
to distinguish; for we shall not have to treat all kinds
of interdictions in this chapter.</p>

<p>First of all, beside those coming from religion, there are others
which are due to magic. The two have this in common, that
they declare certain things incompatible, and prescribe the
separation of the things whose incompatibility is thus proclaimed.
But there are also very grave differences between them. In the
first place, the sanctions are not the same in the two cases. Of
course the violation of the religious interdicts is frequently
believed, as we shall presently see, to bring about material disorders
mechanically, from which the guilty man will suffer, and
which are regarded as a judgment on his act. But even if these
really come about this spontaneous and automatic judgment is
not the only one; it is always completed by another one, supposing
human intervention. A real punishment is added to
this, if it does not anticipate it, and this one is deliberately
inflicted by men; or at least there is a blame and public reprobation.
Even when the sacrilege has been punished, as it were,
by the sickness or natural death of its author, it is also defamed;
it offends opinion, which reacts against it; it puts the man who
did it in fault. On the contrary, the magic interdiction is judged
only by the material consequences which the forbidden act is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
believed to produce, with a sort of physical necessity. In disobeying,
a man runs risks similar to those to which an invalid
exposes himself in not following the advice of his physician;
but in this case disobedience is not a fault; it creates no indignation.
There is no sin in magic. Moreover, this difference in
sanction is due to a profound difference in the nature of the
interdictions. The religious interdiction necessarily implies the
notion of sacredness; it comes from the respect inspired by the
sacred object, and its purpose is to keep this respect from failing.
On the other hand, the interdictions of magic suppose only a
wholly lay notion of property. The things which the magician
recommends to be kept separate are those which, by reason of
their characteristic properties, cannot be brought together and
confused without danger. Even if he happens to ask his clients
to keep at a distance from certain sacred things, it is not through
respect for them and fear that they may be profaned, for, as we
know, magic lives on profanations;<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> it is merely for reasons of
temporal utility. In a word, religious interdictions are categorical
imperatives; others are useful maxims, the first form of hygienic
and medical interdictions. We cannot study two orders of facts
as different as these simultaneously, or even under the same
name, without confusion. We are only concerned with the
religious interdictions here.<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>But a new distinction is necessary between these latter.</p>

<p>There are religious interdictions whose object is to separate
two sacred things of different species from each other. For
example, it will be remembered that among the Wakelbura the
scaffold upon which the corpse is exposed must be made exclusively
of materials belonging to the phratry of the dead man;
this is as much as to say that all contact between the corpse,
which is sacred, and the things of the other phratry, which are
also sacred, but differently, is forbidden. Elsewhere, the arms
which one uses to hunt an animal with cannot be made out of a
kind of wood that is classed in the same social group as the animal
itself.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> But the most important of these interdictions are the
ones which we shall study in the next chapter; they are intended
to prevent all communication between the purely sacred and
the impurely sacred, between the sacredly auspicious and the
sacredly inauspicious. All these interdictions have one common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
characteristic; they come, not from the fact that some things
are sacred while others are not, but from the fact that there
are inequalities and incompatibilities between sacred things. So
they do not touch what is essential in the idea of sacredness.
The observance of these prohibitions can give place only to
isolated rites which are particular and almost exceptional; but
it could not make a real cult, for before all, a cult is made by
regular relations between the profane and the sacred as such.</p>

<p>But there is another system of religious interdictions which is
much more extended and important; this is the one which
separates, not different species of sacred things, but all that is
sacred from all that is profane. So it is derived immediately
from the notion of sacredness itself, and it limits itself to expressing
and realizing this. Thus it furnishes the material for a veritable
cult, and even of a cult which is at the basis of all the others;
for the attitude which it prescribes is one from which the worshipper
must never depart in all his relations with the sacred.
It is what we call the negative cult. We may say that its interdicts
are the religious interdicts <i>par excellence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> It is only these
that we shall discuss in the following pages.</p>

<p>But they take multiple forms. Here are the principal ones
which we observe in Australia.</p>

<p>Before all are the interdictions of contact; these are the original
taboos, of which the others are scarcely more than particular
varieties. They rest upon the principle that the profane should
never touch the sacred. We have seen already that the uninitiated
may not touch the churinga or the bull-roarers under any
circumstances. If adults are allowed the free use of them, it is
because initiation has conferred a sacred character upon them.
Blood, and especially that which flows during the initiation, has
a religious virtue;<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> it is under the same interdict.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> It is the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
with the hair.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> A dead man is sacred because the soul which
animated the body stays with the corpse; for this reason it is
sometimes forbidden to carry the bones of a dead man about
unless they are wrapped up in a piece of bark.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> Even the place
where the death took place should be avoided, for they believe
that the soul of the dead man continues to haunt the spot. That
is why they break camp and move some distance away;<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> in
certain cases they destroy it along with everything it contains,<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>
and a certain time must elapse before they can come back to the
same place.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> Thus it comes about that a dying man creates an
empty space about him; they abandon him after they have
installed him as comfortably as possible.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>An exceptionally intimate contact is the one resulting from
the absorption of food. Hence comes the interdiction against
eating the sacred animals or vegetables, and especially those
serving as totems.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Such an act appears so very sacrilegious
that the prohibition covers even adults, or at least, the majority
of them; only the old men attain a sufficient religious dignity
to escape this interdict sometimes. This prohibition has sometimes
been explained by the mythical kinship uniting the man
to the animals whose name he bears; they are protected by the
sentiment of sympathy which they inspire by their position as
kin.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> But the fact that the consumption of the forbidden flesh
is believed to cause sickness or death automatically shows that
this interdiction does not have its origin in the simple revolt of
the feeling of domestic relationship. Forces of another sort are
in action which are analogous to those in all religions and which
are believed to react against sacrileges.</p>

<p>Moreover, if certain foods are forbidden to the profane because
they are sacred, certain others, on the contrary, are forbidden
to persons of a sacred character, because they are profane. Thus
it frequently happens that certain animals are specially designated
as the food of women; for this reason, they believe that
they partake of a feminine nature and that they are consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
profane. On the other hand, the young initiate is submitted to
a series of rites of particular severity; to give him the virtues
which will enable him to enter into the world of sacred things,
from which he had up till then been excluded, they centre an
exceptionally powerful group of religious forces upon him. Thus
he enters into a state of sanctity which keeps all that is profane
at a distance. Then he is not allowed to eat the game which is
regarded as the special food of women.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

<p>But contact may be established by other means than the touch.
One comes into relations with a thing by merely regarding it: a
look is a means of contact. This is why the sight of sacred
things is forbidden to the profane in certain cases. A woman
should never see the instruments of the cult; the most that is
permitted her is to catch a glimpse of them from afar.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> It is
the same with the totemic paintings executed on the bodies of
the officiants in the exceptionally important ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> The
exceptional solemnity of the rites of initiation prevents the women
in certain tribes from seeing the place where they were celebrated<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>
or even the neophyte himself.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> The sacred character which is
imminent in the ceremony as a whole is naturally found in the
persons of those who directed it or took some part in it; the
result of this is that the novice may not raise his eyes to them,
and this interdiction continues even after the rite is accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
A dead man is also removed from view sometimes: his face is
covered over in such a way that it cannot be seen.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>The word is another way of entering into relations with persons
or things. The breath expired establishes a communication;
this is a part of us which spreads outwards. Thus it is forbidden
to the profane to address the sacred beings or simply to speak
in their presence. Just as the neophyte must not regard either
the operators or the assistants, so it is forbidden to him to converse
with them except by signs; and this interdiction keeps
the place to which it has been raised, by means of a special rite.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>In a general way, there are, among the Arunta, moments in the
course of the great ceremonies when silence is obligatory.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> As
soon as the churinga are exposed, every one keeps still, or if
someone talks, he does so in a low voice or with his lips only.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>Besides the sacred things, there are words and sounds which
have the same character; they should not pass the lips of the
profane or enter their ears. There are ritual songs which women
must not hear under pain of death.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> They may hear the noise of
the bull-roarers, but only from a distance. Every proper name is
considered an essential element of the person who bears it; being
closely associated in the mind to the idea of this person, it participates
in the sentiments which this latter inspires. So if the one is
sacred, the other is. Therefore, it may not be pronounced in the
course of the profane life. Among the Warramunga there is one
totem which is particularly venerated, this is the snake called
Wollunqua; its name is taboo.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> It is the same with Baiame,
Daramulun and Bunjil; the esoteric form of their name must
not be revealed to the uninitiate.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> During mourning, the name
of the dead man must not be mentioned, at least by his parents,
except when there is an absolute necessity, and even in this case
it must be whispered.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> This interdiction is frequently perpetual
for the widow and certain relatives.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Among certain peoples,
this even extends beyond the family; all the individuals whose
name is the same as that of the dead man must change theirs
temporarily.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> But there is more than this: the relatives and
intimate friends sometimes abstain from certain words in the
usual language, undoubtedly because they were employed by
the dead man; these gaps are filled in by means of periphrases
or words taken from some foreign dialects.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> In addition to their
public and everyday names all men have another which is kept
a secret: the women and children do not know it; it is never
used in the ordinary life. This is because it has a religious
character.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> There are even ceremonies during which it is necessary
to speak a special language which must not be used for
profane purposes. It is the beginning of a sacred language.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>Not only are the sacred beings separated from the profane,
but also nothing which either directly or indirectly concerns the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
profane life should be confused with the religious life. Complete
nudity is frequently demanded of the native as a prerequisite
to being admitted to participation in the rites;<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> he is required
to strip himself of all his habitual ornaments, even those to which
he is the most attached, and from which he separates himself the
least willingly because of the protecting virtues he attributes
to them.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> If he is obliged to decorate himself to play his part
in the ritual, this decoration has to be made specially for the
occasion; it is a ceremonial costume, a gala dress.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> As these
ornaments are sacred, owing to the use made of them, he is
forbidden to use them in profane affairs; when the ceremony
is finished, they are buried or burnt;<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> the men must even wash
themselves in such a way as to carry away with them no trace
of the decorations with which they were adorned.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>In general, all acts characteristic of the ordinary life are forbidden
while those of the religious life are taking place. The
act of eating is, of itself, profane; for it takes place every day, it
satisfies essentially utilitarian and material needs and it is a part
of our ordinary existence.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> This is why it is prohibited in religious
times. When one totemic group has loaned its churinga to a
foreign clan, it is an exceptionally solemn moment when they are
brought back and put into the ertnatulunga; all those who take
part in the ceremony must fast as long as it lasts, and it lasts a
long time.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> The same rule is observed during the rites,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> of which
we shall speak in the next chapter, as well as at certain moments
of the initiation.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>For this same reason, all temporal occupations are suspended
while the great religious solemnities are taking place. According
to a remark of Spencer and Gillen,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> which we have already had
occasion to cite, the life of the Australian is divided into two
very distinct parts: the one is devoted to hunting, fishing and
warfare; the other is consecrated to the cult, and these two forms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of activity mutually exclude and repel one another. It is on
this principle that the universal institution of religious days of
rest reposes. The distinctive character of the feast-days in all
known religions is the cessation of work and the suspension of
public and private life, in so far as it does not have a religious
objective. This repose is not merely a sort of temporary relaxation
which men have given themselves in order to give themselves
up more freely to the sentiments of joy ordinarily awakened by
the feast-days; for they are sad feasts, consecrated to mourning
and repentance, and during which this cessation is no less obligatory.
This is because work is an eminent form of profane activity:
it has no other apparent end than to provide for the temporal
necessities of life; it puts us in relations with ordinary things
only. On feast days, on the contrary, the religious life attains
an exceptional degree of intensity. So the contrast between the
two forms of existence is especially marked at this moment;
consequently, they cannot remain near to each other. A man
cannot approach his god intimately while he still bears on him
marks of his profane life; inversely, he cannot return to his usual
occupations when a rite has just sanctified him. So the ritual
day of rest is only one particular case of the general incompatibility
separating the sacred from the profane; it is the result
of an interdiction.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate here all the different
interdictions which have been observed, even in the Australian
religions alone. Like the notion of sacredness upon which it
rests, the system of interdicts extends into the most diverse
relations; it is even used deliberately for utilitarian ends.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
But howsoever complex it may be, it finally rests upon two
fundamental interdictions, which summarize it and dominate it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the religious life and the profane life cannot
coexist in the same place. If the former is to develop, a special
spot must be placed at its disposition, from which the second is
excluded. Hence comes the founding of temples and sanctuaries:
these are the spots awarded to sacred beings and things and serve
them as residences, for they cannot establish themselves in any
place except on the condition of entirely appropriating to themselves
all within a certain distance. Such arrangements are so
indispensable to all religious life that even the most inferior
religions cannot do without them. The ertnatulunga, the spot
where the churinga are deposited, is a veritable sanctuary. So
the uninitiated are not allowed to approach it. It is even forbidden
to carry on any profane occupation whatsoever there.
As we shall presently see, there are other holy places where
important ceremonies are celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<p>Likewise, the religious life and the profane life cannot coexist
in the same unit of time. It is necessary to assign determined
days or periods to the first, from which all profane occupations
are excluded. Thus feast days are born. There is no religion,
and, consequently, no society which has not known and practised
this division of time into two distinct parts, alternating with
one another according to a law varying with the peoples and the
civilizations; as we have already pointed out, it was probably
the necessity of this alternation which led men to introduce into
the continuity and homogeneity of duration, certain distinctions
and differentiations which it does not naturally have.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> Of
course, it is almost impossible that the religious life should
ever succeed in concentrating itself hermetically in the places
and times which are thus attributed to it; it is inevitable that
a little of it should filter out. There are always some sacred
things outside the sanctuaries; there are some rites that can
be celebrated on work-days. But these are sacred things of the
second rank and rites of a lesser importance. Concentration
remains the dominating characteristic of this organization.
Generally this concentration is complete for all that concerns
the public cult, which cannot be celebrated except in common.
The individual, private cult is the only one which comes very
near to the temporal life. Thus the contrast between these
two successive phases of human life attains its maximum of
intensity in the inferior societies; for it is there that the individual
cult is the most rudimentary.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Up to the present, the negative cult has been presented to us
only as a system of abstentions. So it seems to serve only to
inhibit activity, and not to stimulate it or to modify it. And
yet, as an unexpected reaction to this inhibitive effect, it is
found to exercise a positive action of the highest importance
over the religious and moral nature of the individual.</p>

<p>In fact, owing to the barrier which separates the sacred
from the profane, a man cannot enter into intimate relations
with sacred things except after ridding himself of all that is
profane in him. He cannot lead a religious life of even a slight
intensity unless he commences by withdrawing more or less
completely from the temporal life. So the negative cult is in one
sense a means in view of an end: it is a condition of access to the
positive cult. It does not confine itself to protecting sacred
beings from vulgar contact; it acts upon the worshipper himself
and modifies his condition positively. The man who has submitted
himself to its prescribed interdictions is not the same
afterwards as he was before. Before, he was an ordinary being
who, for this reason, had to keep at a distance from the religious
forces. Afterwards, he is on a more equal footing with them;
he has approached the sacred by the very act of leaving the
profane; he has purified and sanctified himself by the very
act of detaching himself from the base and trivial matters that
debased his nature. So the negative rites confer efficient powers
just as well as the positive ones; the first, like the second, can
serve to elevate the religious tone of the individual. According to
a very true remark which has been made, no one can engage in
a religious ceremony of any importance without first submitting
himself to a sort of preliminary initiation which introduces
him progressively into the sacred world.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Unctions, lustrations,
benedictions or any essentially positive operation may be used
for this purpose; but the same result may be attained by means
of fasts and vigils or retreat and silence, that is to say, by ritual
abstinences, which are nothing more than certain interdictions
put into practice.</p>

<p>When there are only particular and isolated negative rites,
their positive action is generally too slight to be easily perceptible.
But there are circumstances when a whole system of interdictions
is concentrated on one man; in these cases, their effects accumulate,
and thus become more manifest. This takes place in Australia
at the time of the initiation. The neophyte is submitted to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
great variety of negative rites. He must withdraw from the
society in which his existence has been passed up till then, and
from almost all human society. Not only is it forbidden for him
to see women and uninitiated persons,<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> but he also goes to live
in the brush, far from his fellows, under the direction of some
old men who serve him as godfathers.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> So very true is it that
the forest is considered his natural environment, that in a certain
number of tribes, the word with which the initiation is designated
signifies <i>that which is from the forest</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> For this same reason, he
is frequently decorated with leaves during the ceremonies at
which he assists.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> In this way he passes long months,<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> interspersed
from time to time with rites in which he must take a
part. This time is a period of all sorts of abstinences for him.
A multitude of foods are forbidden him; he is allowed only
that quantity of food which is absolutely indispensable for the
maintenance of life;<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> he is even sometimes bound to a rigorous
fast,<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> or must eat impure foods.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> When he eats, he must not
touch the food with his hands; his godfathers put it into his
mouth for him.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> In some cases, he must go to beg his food.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
Likewise, he sleeps only as much as is indispensable.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> He
must abstain from talking, to the extent of not uttering a word;
it is by signs that he makes known his needs.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> He must not
wash;<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> sometimes he must not move. He remains stretched
out upon the earth, immobile<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> and without clothing of any
sort.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> Now the result of the numerous interdictions is to bring
about a radical change of condition in the initiate. Before the
initiation, he lived with the women; he was excluded from the
cult. After it, he is admitted to the society of men; he takes
part in the rites, and has acquired a sacred character. The metamorphosis
is so complete that it is sometimes represented as a
second birth. They imagine that the profane person, who was
the young man up till then, has died, that he has been killed and
carried away by the god of the initiation, Bunjil, Baiame or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Daramulun, and that quite another individual has taken the
place of the one that no longer is.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> So here we find the very
heart of the positive effects of which negative rites are capable.
Of course we do not mean to say that these latter produced this
great transformation all by themselves; but they certainly
contributed to it, and largely.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts, we are able to understand what
asceticism is, what place it occupies in the religious life and
whence come the virtues which have generally been attributed
to it. In fact, there is no interdict, the observance of which
does not have an ascetic character to a certain degree. Abstaining
from something which may be useful or from a form of activity
which, since it is usual, should answer to some human need,
is, of necessity, imposing constraints and renunciations. So in
order to have real asceticism, it is sufficient for these practices
to develop in such a way as to become the basis of a veritable
scheme of life. Normally, the negative cult serves only as an
introduction and preparation for the positive cult. But it
sometimes happens that it frees itself from this subordination
and passes to the first place, and that the system of interdicts
swells and exaggerates itself to the point of usurping the entire
existence. Thus a systematic asceticism is born which is consequently
nothing more than a hypertrophy of the negative cult.
The special virtues which it is believed to confer are only an
amplified form of those conferred, to a lesser degree, by the
practice of any interdiction. They have the same origin; for
they both rest on the principle that a man sanctifies himself only
by efforts made to separate himself from the profane. The
pure ascetic is a man who raises himself above men and acquires
a special sanctity by fasts and vigils, by retreat and silence, or in
a word, by privations, rather than by acts of positive piety
(offerings, sacrifices, prayers, etc.). History shows to what
a high religious prestige one may attain by this method: the
Buddhist saint is essentially an ascetic, and he is equal or superior
to the gods.</p>

<p>It follows that asceticism is not a rare, exceptional and nearly
abnormal fruit of the religious life, as some have supposed it to
be; on the contrary, it is one of its essential elements. Every
religion contains it, at least in germ, for there are none in which
a system of interdicts is not found. Their only difference in this
regard which there may be between cults is that this germ is
more or less developed in different ones. It should also be added
that there probably is not a single one in which this development
does not take, at least temporarily, the characteristic traits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
real asceticism. This is what generally takes place at certain
critical periods when, for a relatively short time, it is necessary
to bring about a grave change of condition in a subject. Then,
in order to introduce him more rapidly into the circle of sacred
things with which he must be put in contact, he is separated
violently from the profane world; but this does not come
without many abstinences and an exceptional recrudescence
of the system of interdicts. Now this is just what happens in
Australia at the moment of initiation. In order to transform
youths into men, it is necessary to make them live the life of a
veritable ascetic. Mrs. Parker very justly calls them the monks
of Baiame.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<p>But abstinences and privations do not come without suffering.
We hold to the profane world by all the fibres of our flesh;
our senses attach us to it; our life depends upon it. It is not
merely the natural theatre of our activity; it penetrates us
from every side; it is a part of ourselves. So we cannot detach
ourselves from it without doing violence to our nature and
without painfully wounding our instincts. In other words, the
negative cult cannot develop without causing suffering. Pain is one
of its necessary conditions. Some have been led to think of it as
constituting a sort of rite in itself; they have seen in it a state
of grace which is to be sought and aroused, even artificially,
because of the powers and privileges which it confers in the same
way as these systems of interdicts, of which it is the natural
accompaniment. So far as we know, Preuss is the first who has
realized the religious r&ocirc;le<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> which is attributed to suffering in the
inferior societies. He cites the case of the Arapahs who inflict
veritable torments upon themselves in order to become immune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
from the dangers of battle; of the Big Belly Indians who submit
to actual tortures on the eve of military expeditions; of the
Hupa who swim in icy rivers and then remain stretched out on
the bank as long as possible, in order to assure themselves of
success in their enterprises; of the Karaya who from time to
time draw blood from their arms and legs by means of scratches
made out of the teeth of fish, in order to strengthen their muscles;
of the men of Dallmannhafen (Emperor William's Land in New
Guinea) who combat the sterility of their women by making
bloody incisions in the upper part of their thighs.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a></p>

<p>But similar facts may be found without leaving Australia,
especially in the course of the initiation ceremonies. Many
of the rites practised on this occasion consist in systematically
inflicting certain pains on the neophyte in order to modify his
condition and to make him acquire the qualities characteristic
of a man. Thus, among the Larakia, while the young men are
in retreat in the forest, their godfathers and guardians give
them violent blows at any instant, without warning and without
cause.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> Among the Urabunna, at a certain time, the novice is
stretched out on the ground, his face against the earth. All the
men present beat him rudely; then they make four or eight
gashes on his back, arranged on each side of the dorsal spine
and one on the meridial line of the nape of his neck.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> Among
the Arunta, the first rite of the initiation consists in tossing the
subject in a blanket; the men throw him into the air and catch
him when he comes down, to throw him up again.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> In the same
tribe, at the close of this long series of ceremonies, the young
man lies down on a bed of leaves under which they have placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
live coals; he remains there, immobile in the midst of the heat
and suffocating smoke.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> A similar rite is observed among the
Urabunna; but in addition, while the patient is in this painful
situation, they beat him on the back.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> In a general way, all the
exercises to which he is submitted have this same character to
such an extent that when he is allowed to re-enter the ordinary
life, he has a pitiful aspect and appears half stupefied.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> It is
true that all these practices are frequently represented as ordeals
destined to prove the value of the neophyte and to show whether
he is worthy of being admitted into the religious society or not.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>
But in reality, the probational function of the rite is only another
aspect of its efficacy. For the fact that it has been undergone
is proved by its producing its effect, that is to say, by its conferring
the qualities which are the original reason for its existence.</p>

<p>In other cases, these ritual cruelties are executed, not on the
organism as a whole, but on a particular organ or tissue, whose
vitality it is their object to stimulate. Thus, among the Arunta,
the Warramunga and many other tribes,<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> at a certain moment
in the initiation, certain persons are charged with biting the
novice severely in the scalp. This operation is so painful that
the patient can hardly support it without uttering cries. Its
object is to make the hair grow.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> The same treatment is applied
to make the beard grow. The rite of pulling out hairs, which
Howitt mentions in other tribes, seems to have the same reason
for existence.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> According to Eylmann, the men and women of
the Arunta and the Kaitish make small wounds on their arms
with sticks red with fire, in order to become skilful in making
fire or to acquire the strength necessary for carrying heavy loads

girls amputate the second and third joints of the index finger

<p>It is not impossible that the extraction of teeth was sometimes
destined to produce effects of this sort. In any case, it is certain
that the cruel rites of circumcision and subincision have the
object of conferring particular powers on the genital organs.
In fact, the young man is not allowed to marry until after he has
undergone them; so he owes them special virtues. What makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
this initiation <i>sui generis</i> indispensable is that in all inferior
societies, the union of the sexes is marked with a religious character.
It is believed to put redoubtable forces into play which
a man cannot approach without danger, until after he has acquired
the necessary immunity, by ritual processes:<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> for this, a whole
series of positive and negative practices is used, of which circumcision
and subincision are the forerunners. By painfully mutilating
an organ, a sacred character is given to it, since by that act, it is
put into shape for resisting the equally sacred forces which it
could not meet otherwise.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this work, we said that all the essential
elements of religious thought and life ought to be found, at least
in germ, in the most primitive religions: the preceding facts
confirm this assertion. If there is any one belief which is believed
to be peculiar to the most recent and idealistic religions, it is the
one attributing a sanctifying power to sorrow. Now this same
belief is at the basis of the rites which have just been observed.
Of course, it is understood differently at the different moments
of history when it is studied. For the Christian, it acts especially
upon the soul: it purges it, ennobles it, spiritualizes it. For the
Australian, it is the body over which it is efficient: it increases
its vital energies; it makes its beard and hair grow; it toughens
its members. But in both cases the principle is the same. In
both it is admitted that suffering creates exceptional strength.
And this belief is not without foundation. In fact, it is by the
way in which he braves suffering that the greatness of a man
is best manifested. He never rises above himself with more
brilliancy than when he subdues his own nature to the point of
making it follow a way contrary to the one it would spontaneously
take. By this, he distinguishes himself from all the other creatures
who follow blindly wherever pleasure calls them; by this, he
makes a place apart for himself in the world. Suffering is the
sign that certain of the bonds attaching him to his profane
environment are broken; so it testifies that he is partially
freed from this environment, and, consequently, it is justly
considered the instrument of deliverance. So he who is thus
delivered is not the victim of a pure illusion when he believes
himself invested with a sort of mastery over things: he really
has raised himself above them, by the very act of renouncing
them; he is stronger than nature, because he makes it
subside.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is by no means true that this virtue has only an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
&aelig;sthetic value: the whole religious life supposes it. Sacrifices
and privations do not come without privations which cost the
worshipper dear. Even if the rites do not demand material
gifts from him, they require his time and his strength. In order
to serve his gods, he must forget himself; to make for them a
fitting place in his own life, he must sacrifice his profane interests.
The positive cult is possible only when a man is trained to
renouncement, to abnegation, to detachment from self, and
consequently to suffering. It is necessary that he have no dread
of them: he cannot even fulfil his duties joyfully unless he loves
them to some extent. But for that, it is necessary that he train
himself, and it is to this that the ascetic practices tend. So the
suffering which they impose is not arbitrary and sterile cruelty;
it is a necessary school, where men form and temper themselves,
and acquire the qualities of disinterestedness and endurance
without which there would be no religion. If this result is to
be obtained, it is even a good thing that the ascetic ideal be
incarnated eminently in certain persons, whose speciality, so
to speak, it is to represent, almost with excess, this aspect of
the ritual life; for they are like so many living models, inciting
to effort. Such is the historic r&ocirc;le of the great ascetics. When
their deeds and acts are analysed in detail, one asks himself
what useful end they can have. He is struck by the fact that
there is something excessive in the disdain they profess for all
that ordinarily impassions men. But these exaggerations are
necessary to sustain among the believers a sufficient disgust for
an easy life and common pleasures. It is necessary that an elite
put the end too high, if the crowd is not to put it too low. It is
necessary that some exaggerate, if the average is to remain at
a fitting level.</p>

<p>But asceticism does not serve religious ends only. Here, as
elsewhere, religious interests are only the symbolic form of
social and moral interests. The ideal beings to whom the cults
are addressed are not the only ones who demand of their followers
a certain disdain for suffering: society itself is possible only
at this price. Though exalting the strength of man, it is frequently
rude to individuals; it necessarily demands perpetual sacrifices
from them; it is constantly doing violence to our natural appetites,
just because it raises us above ourselves. If we are going
to fulfil our duties towards it, then we must be prepared to do
violence to our instincts sometimes and to ascend the decline
of nature when it is necessary. So there is an asceticism which,
being inherent in all social life, is destined to survive all the
mythologies and all the dogmas; it is an integral part of all
human culture. At bottom, this is the asceticism which is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
reason for the existence of and the justification of that which
has been taught by the religions of all times.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Having determined what the system of interdicts consists in
and what its positive and negative functions are, we must now
seek the causes which have given it birth.</p>

<p>In one sense, it is logically implied in the very notion of sacredness.
All that is sacred is the object of respect, and every
sentiment of respect is translated, in him who feels it, by movements
of inhibition. In fact, a respected being is always expressed
in the consciousness by a representation which, owing to the
emotion it inspires, is charged with a high mental energy; consequently,
it is armed in such a way as to reject to a distance
every other representation which denies it in whole or in part.
Now the sacred world and the profane world are antagonistic to
each other. They correspond to two forms of life which mutually
exclude one another, or which at least cannot be lived at the
same time with the same intensity. We cannot give ourselves
up entirely to the ideal beings to whom the cult is addressed
and also to ourselves and our own interests at the same time;
we cannot devote ourselves entirely to the group and entirely
to our own egoism at once. Here there are two systems of
conscious states which are directed and which direct our conduct
towards opposite poles. So the one having the greater power of
action should tend to exclude the other from the consciousness.
When we think of holy things, the idea of a profane object cannot
enter the mind without encountering grave resistance; something
within us opposes itself to its installation. This is because the
representation of a sacred thing does not tolerate neighbours.
But this psychic antagonism and this mutual exclusion of ideas
should naturally result in the exclusion of the corresponding
things. If the ideas are not to coexist, the things must not
touch each other or have any sort of relations. This is the very
principle of the interdict.</p>

<p>Moreover, the world of sacred things is, by definition, a world
apart. Since it is opposed to the profane world by all the characteristics
we have mentioned, it must be treated in its own peculiar
way: it would be a misunderstanding of its nature and a confusion
of it with something that it is not, to make use of the
gestures, language and attitudes which we employ in our relations
with ordinary things, when we have to do with the things
that compose it. We may handle the former freely; we speak
freely to vulgar beings; so we do not touch the sacred beings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
or we touch them only with reserve; we do not speak in their
presence, or we do not speak the common language there. All
that is used in our commerce with the one must be excluded
from our commerce with the other.</p>

<p>But if this explanation is not inexact, it is, nevertheless,
insufficient. In fact, there are many beings which are the
objects of respect without being protected by systems of rigorous
interdictions such as those we have just described. Of course
there is a general tendency of the mind to localize different things
in different places, especially when they are incompatible with
each other. But the profane environment and the sacred one
are not merely distinct, but they are also closed to one another;
between them there is an abyss. So there ought to be some
particular reason in the nature of sacred things, which causes
this exceptional isolation and mutual exclusion. And, in fact,
by a sort of contradiction, the sacred world is inclined, as it
were, to spread itself into this same profane world which it
excludes elsewhere: at the same time that it repels it, it tends to
flow into it as soon as it approaches. This is why it is necessary
to keep them at a distance from one another and to create a
sort of vacuum between them.</p>

<p>What makes these precautions necessary is the extraordinary
contagiousness of a sacred character. Far from being attached
to the things which are marked with it, it is endowed with a
sort of elusiveness. Even the most superficial or roundabout
contact is sufficient to enable it to spread from one object to
another. Religious forces are represented in the mind in such
a way that they always seem ready to escape from the points
where they reside and to enter everything passing within their
range. The nanja tree where the spirit of an ancestor lives is
sacred for the individual who considers himself the reincarnation
of this ancestor. But every bird which alights upon this tree
participates in this same nature: it is also forbidden to touch
it.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> We have already had occasion to show how simple contact
with a churinga is enough to sanctify men and things;<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> it is
also upon this principle of the contagiousness of sacredness
that all the rites of consecration repose. The sanctity of the
churinga is so great that its action is even felt at a distance.
It will be remembered how this extends not only to the cave
where they are kept, but also to the whole surrounding district,
to the animals who take refuge there, whom it is forbidden to
kill, and to the plants which grow there, which must not be
touched.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> A snake totem has its centre at a place where there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
is a water-hole. The sacred character of the totem is communicated
to this place, to the water-hole and even to the water
itself, which is forbidden to all the members of the totemic group.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
The initiate lives in an atmosphere charged with religiousness,
and it is as though he were impregnated with it himself.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> Consequently
all that he possesses and all that he touches is forbidden
to the women, and withdrawn from their contact, even down to
the bird he has struck with his stick, the kangaroo he has pierced
with his lance or the fish which has bit on his hook.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> But, on
the other hand, the rites to which he is submitted and the things
which have a part in them have a sanctity superior to his own:
this sanctity is contagiously transmitted to everything which
evokes the idea of one or the other. The tooth which has been
knocked out of him is considered very holy.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> For this reason,
he may not eat animals with prominent teeth, because they
make him think of his own lost tooth. The ceremonies of the
Kuringal terminate with a ritual washing;<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> acquatic birds
are forbidden to the neophyte because they make him think
of this rite. Animals that climb to the tops of trees are equally
sacred for him, because they are too near to Daramulun, the
god of the initiation, who lives in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> The soul of a dead
man is a sacred thing: we have already seen how this same
property passes to the corpse in which the soul resided, to the
spot where this is buried, to the camp in which he lived when
alive, and which is either destroyed or quitted, to the name he
bore, to his wife and to his relations.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> They, too, are invested,
as it were, with a sacred character; consequently, men keep
at a distance from them; they do not treat them as mere profane
beings. In the societies observed by Dawson, their names,
like that of the dead man, cannot be pronounced during the
period of mourning.<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> Certain animals which he ate may also be
prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>This contagiousness of sacredness is too well known a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
phenomenon<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> to require any proof of its existence from numerous
examples; we only wish to show that it is as true in totemism
as in the more advanced religions. When once established, it
quickly explains the extreme rigour of the interdicts separating
the sacred from the profane. Since, in virtue of this extraordinary
power of expansion, the slightest contact, the least proximity,
either material or simply moral, suffices to draw religious forces
out of their domain, and since, on the other hand, they cannot
leave it without contradicting their nature, a whole system of
measures is indispensable for maintaining the two worlds at a
respectful distance from one another. This is why it is forbidden
to the profane, not only to touch, but even to see or hear that
which is sacred, and why these two sorts of life cannot be mixed
in their consciousnesses. Precautions are necessary to keep them
apart because, though opposing one another, they tend to
confuse themselves into one another.</p>

<p>When we understand the multiplicity of these interdicts we
also understand the way in which they operate and the sanctions
which are attached to them. Owing to the contagiousness
inherent in all that is sacred, a profane being cannot violate
an interdict without having the religious force, to which he has
unduly approached, extend itself over him and establish its
empire over him. But as there is an antagonism between them,
he becomes dependent upon a hostile power, whose hostility
cannot fail to manifest itself in the form of violent reactions
which tend to destroy him. This is why sickness or death are
considered the natural consequences of every transgression of
this sort; and they are consequences which are believed to
come by themselves, with a sort of physical necessity. The guilty
man feels himself attacked by a force which dominates him and
against which he is powerless. Has he eaten the totemic animal?
Then he feels it penetrating him and gnawing at his vitals; he lies
down on the ground and awaits death.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> Every profanation implies
a consecration, but one which is dreadful, both for the subject consecrated
and for those who approach him. It is the consequences
of this consecration which sanction, in part, the interdict.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<p>It should be noticed that this explanation of the interdicts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
does not depend upon the variable symbols by the aid of which
religious forces are conceived. It matters little whether these
are conceived as anonymous and impersonal energies or figured
as personalities endowed with consciousness and feeling. In the
former case, of course, they are believed to react against profaning
transgressions in an automatic and unconscious manner,
while in the latter case, they are thought to obey passionate
movements determined by the offence resented. But at bottom,
these two conceptions, which, moreover, have the same practical
effect, only express one and the same psychic mechanism in two
different languages. The basis of both is the antagonism of the
sacred and the profane, combined with the remarkable aptitude
of the former for spreading over to the latter; now this antagonism
and this contagiousness act in the same way, whether the sacred
character is attributed to blind forces or to conscious ones. Thus,
so far is it from being true that the real religious life commences
only where there are mythical personalities, that we see that in
this case the rite remains the same, whether the religious beings
are personified or not. This is a statement which we shall have
occasion to repeat in each of the chapters which follow.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>But if this contagiousness of sacredness helps to explain the
system of interdicts, how is it to be explained itself?</p>

<p>Some have tried to explain it with the well-known laws of
the association of ideas. The sentiments inspired in us by a
person or a thing spread contagiously from the idea of this thing
or person to the representations associated with it, and thence
to the objects which these representations express. So the
respect which we have for a sacred being is communicated to
everything touching this being, or resembling it, or recalling it.
Of course a cultivated man is not deceived by these associations;
he knows that these derived emotions are due to mere plays of the
images and to entirely mental combinations, so he does not give
way to the superstitions which these illusions tend to bring about.
But they say that the primitive na&iuml;vely objectifies his impressions,
without criticising them. Does something inspire a reverential fear
in him? He concludes that an august and redoubtable force really
resides in it; so he keeps at a distance from this thing and treats it
as though it were sacred, even though it has no right to this title.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>But whoever says this forgets that the most primitive religions
are not the only ones which have attributed this power of propagation
to the sacred character. Even in the most recent cults,
there is a group of rites which repose upon this principle. Does
not every consecration by means of anointing or washing consist
in transferring into a profane object the sanctifying virtues of
a sacred one? Yet it is difficult to regard an enlightened Catholic
of to-day as a sort of retarded savage who continues to be deceived
by his associations of ideas, while nothing in the nature of things
explains or justifies these ways of thinking. Moreover, it is
quite arbitrarily that they attribute to the primitive this tendency
to objectify blindly all his emotions. In his ordinary life, and in
the details of his lay occupations, he does not impute the properties
of one thing to its neighbours, or <i>vice versa</i>. If he is less careful
than we are about clarity and distinction, still it is far from true
that he has some vague, deplorable aptitude for jumbling and
confusing everything. Religious thought alone has a marked
leaning towards these sorts of confusions. So it is in something
special to the nature of religious things, and not in the general
laws of the human intelligence, that the origin of these predispositions
is to be sought.</p>

<p>When a force or property seems to be an integral part or
constituent element of the subject in which it resides, we cannot
easily imagine its detaching itself and going elsewhere. A body
is defined by its mass and its atomic composition; so we do
not think that it could communicate any of these distinctive
characteristics by means of contact. But, on the other hand,
if we are dealing with a force which has penetrated the body
from without, since nothing attaches it there and since it is
foreign to the body, there is nothing inconceivable in its escaping
again. Thus the heat or electricity which a body has received
from some external source may be transmitted to the surrounding
medium, and the mind readily accepts the possibility of this
transmission. So the extreme facility with which religious
forces spread out and diffuse themselves has nothing surprising
about it, if they are generally thought of as outside of the beings
in which they reside. Now this is just what the theory we have
proposed implies.</p>

<p>In fact, they are only collective forces hypostatized, that is to
say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments
awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations
coming from the physical world. So they are not homogeneous
with the visible things among which we place them. They may
well take from these things the outward and material forms
in which they are represented, but they owe none of their efficacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
to them. They are not united by external bonds to the different
supports upon which they alight; they have no roots there;
according to an expression we have already used<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> and which
serves best for characterizing them, <i>they are added to them</i>. So
there are no objects which are predestined to receive them, to
the exclusion of all others; even the most insignificant and
vulgar may do so; accidental circumstances decide which are
the chosen ones. The terms in which Codrington speaks of the
mana should be borne in mind: it is a force, he says, which
"<i>is not fixed in anything and can be conveyed in almost anything</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>
Likewise, the Dakota of Miss Fletcher represented the wakan
as a sort of surrounding force which is always coming and going
through the world, alighting here and there, but definitely fixing
itself nowhere.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> Even the religious character inherent in men
does not have a different character. There is certainly no other
being in the world of experience which is closer to the very source
of all religious life; none participates in it more directly, for it is
in human consciousnesses that it is elaborated. Yet we know
that the religious principle animating men, to wit, the soul, is
partially external.</p>

<p>But if religious forces have a place of their own nowhere,
their mobility is easily explained. Since nothing attaches
them to the things in which we localize them, it is natural that
they should escape on the slightest contact, in spite of themselves,
so to speak, and that they should spread afar. Their intensity
incites them to this spreading, which everything favours. This
is why the soul itself, though holding to the body by very personal
bonds, is constantly threatening to leave it: all the apertures
and pores of the body are just so many ways by which it tends
to spread and diffuse itself into the outside.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<p>But we shall account for this phenomenon which we are
trying to understand, still better if, instead of considering the
notion of religious forces as it is when completely formulated,
we go back to the mental process from which it results.</p>

<p>We have seen, in fact, that the sacred character of a being
does not rest in any of its intrinsic attributes. It is not because
the totemic animal has a certain aspect or property that it inspires
religious sentiments; these result from causes wholly foreign to
the nature of the object upon which they fix themselves. What
constitutes them are the impressions of comfort and dependence
which the action of the society provokes in the mind. Of
themselves, these emotions are not attached to the idea of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
particular object; but as these emotions exist and are especially
intense, they are also eminently contagious. So they make a
stain of oil; they extend to all the other mental states which
occupy the mind; they penetrate and contaminate those representations
especially in which are expressed the various objects
which the man had in his hands or before his eyes at the moment:
the totemic designs covering his body, the bull-roarers which he
was making roar, the rocks surrounding him, the ground under
his feet, etc. It is thus that the objects themselves get a religious
value which is really not inherent in them but is conferred from
without. So the contagion is not a sort of secondary process
by which sacredness is propagated, after it has once been acquired;
it is the very process by which it is acquired. It is by contagion
that it establishes itself: we should not be surprised, therefore,
if it transmits itself contagiously. What makes its reality is a
special emotion; if it attaches itself to some object, it is because
this emotion has found this object in its way. So it is natural
that from this one it should spread to all those which it finds in
its neighbourhood, that is to say, to all those which any reason
whatsoever, either material contiguity or mere similarity, has
mentally connected with the first.</p>

<p>Thus, the contagiousness of sacredness finds its explanation
in the theory which we have proposed of religious forces, and by
this very fact, it serves to confirm our theory.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> And, at the
same time, it aids us in understanding a trait of primitive
mentality to which we have already called the attention.</p>

<p>We have seen<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> the facility with which the primitive confuses
kingdoms and identifies the most heterogeneous things, men,
animals, plants, stars, etc. Now we see one of the causes which
has contributed the most to facilitating these confusions. Since
religious forces are eminently contagious, it is constantly happening
that the same principle animates very different objects
equally; it passes from some into others as the result of either
a simple material proximity or of even a superficial similarity.
It is thus that men, animals, plants and rocks come to have the
same totem: the men because they bear the name of the animal:
the animals because they bring the totemic emblem to mind;
the plants because they nourish these animals; the rocks because
they mark the place where the ceremonies are celebrated. Now
religious forces are therefore considered the source of all efficacy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
so beings having one single religious principle ought to pass as
having the same essence, and as differing from one another only
in secondary characteristics. This is why it seemed quite natural
to arrange them in a single category and to regard them as mere
varieties of the same class, transmutable into one another.</p>

<p>When this relation has been established, it makes the
phenomena of contagion appear under a new aspect. Taken
by themselves, they seem to be quite foreign to the logical life.
Is their effect not to mix and confuse beings, in spite of their
natural differences? But we have seen that these confusions
and participation have played a r&ocirc;le of the highest utility in
logic; they have served to bind together things which sensation
leaves apart from one another. So it is far from true that contagion,
the source of these connections and confusions, is marked
with that fundamental irrationality that one is inclined to
attribute it at first. It has opened the way for the scientific
explanations of the future.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER II</b><br /><br />

<small>THE POSITIVE CULT</small><br /><br />

I.&mdash;<i>The Elements of the Sacrifice</i></h3>


<p>Whatever the importance of the negative cult may be,
and though it may indirectly have positive effects, it
does not contain its reason for existence in itself; it introduces
one to the religious life, but it supposes this more than it constitutes
it. If it orders the worshipper to flee from the profane
world, it is to bring him nearer to the sacred world. Men have
never thought that their duties towards religious forces might
be reduced to a simple abstinence from all commerce; they
have always believed that they upheld positive and bilateral
relations with them, whose regulation and organization is the
function of a group of ritual practices. To this special system
of rites we give the name of <i>positive cult</i>.</p>

<p>For some time we almost completely ignored the positive cult
of the totemic religion and what it consists in. We knew almost
nothing more than the initiation rites, and we do not know those
sufficiently well even now. But the observations of Spencer and
Gillen, prepared for by those of Schulze and confirmed by those
of Strehlow, on the tribes of central Australia, have partially
filled this gap in our information. There is one ceremony especially
which these explorers have taken particular pains to describe
to us and which, moreover, seems to dominate the whole totemic
cult: this is the one that the Arunta, according to Spencer and
Gillen, call the <i>Intichiuma</i>. It is true that Strehlow contests
the meaning of this word. According to him, intichiuma (or,
as he writes it, <i>intijiuma</i>) means "to instruct" and designates
the ceremonies performed before the young man to teach him
the traditions of the tribe. The feast which we are going to
describe bears, he says, the name <i>mbatjalkatiuma</i>, which means
"to fecundate" or "to put into a good condition."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> But we
shall not try to settle this question of vocabulary, which touches
the real problem but slightly, as the rites in question are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
celebrated in the course of the initiation. On the other hand,
as the word Intichiuma now belongs to the current language of
ethnography, and has almost become a common noun, it seems
useless to replace it with another.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>The date on which the Intichiuma takes place depends largely
upon the season. There are two sharply separated seasons in
Australia: one is dry and lasts for a long time; the other is
rainy and is, on the contrary, very short and frequently irregular.
As soon as the rains arrive, vegetation springs up from the ground
as though by enchantment and animals multiply, so that the
country which had recently been only a sterile desert is rapidly
filled with a luxurious flora and fauna. It is just at the moment
when the good season seems to be close at hand that the Intichiuma
is celebrated. But as the rainy season is extremely
variable, the date of the ceremonies cannot be fixed once for all.
It varies with the climatic circumstances, which only the chief
of the totemic group, the Alatunja, is qualified to judge: on
a day which he considers suitable, he informs his companions
that the moment has arrived.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>Each totemic group has its own Intichiuma. Even if this
rite is general in the societies of the centre, it is not the same
everywhere; among the Warramunga, it is not what it is among
the Arunta; it varies, not only among the tribes, but also within
the tribe, among the clans. But it is obvious that the different
mechanisms in use are too closely related to each other to be
dissociated completely. There is no ceremony, perhaps, which
is not made up of several, though these are very unequally
developed: what exists only as a germ in one, occupies the
most important place in another, and inversely. Yet they must
be carefully distinguished, for they constitute just so many
different ritual types to be described and explained separately,
but afterwards we must seek some common source from which
they were derived.</p>

<p>Let us commence with those observed among the Arunta.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The celebration includes two successive phases. The object of
the rites which take place in the first is to assure the prosperity
of the animal or vegetable species serving the clan as totem.
The means employed for this end may be reduced to two principal
types.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that the fabulous ancestors from whom
each clan is supposed to be descended, formerly lived on earth
and left traces of their passage there. These traces consist
especially in stones and rocks which they deposited at certain
places, or which were formed at the spots where they entered
into the ground. These rocks and stones are considered the
bodies or parts of the bodies of the ancestors, whose memory
they keep alive; they represent them. Consequently, they
also represent the animals and plants which served these same
ancestors as totems, for an individual and his totem are only
one. The same reality and the same properties are attributed
to them as to the actually living plants or animals of the same
species. But they have this advantage over these latter, that
they are imperishable, knowing neither sickness nor death.
So they are like a permanent immutable and ever-available
reserve of animal and vegetable life. Also, in a certain number
of cases, it is this reserve that they annually draw upon to assure
the reproduction of the species.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is how the Witchetty grub clan, at Alice
Springs, proceeds at its Intichiuma.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p>On the day fixed by the chief, all the members of the totemic
group assemble in the principal camp. The men of the other
totems retire to a distance;<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> for among the Arunta, they are
not allowed to be present at the celebration of the rite, which
has all the characteristics of a secret ceremony. An individual
of a different totem, but of the same phratry, may be invited
to be present, as a favour; but this is only as a witness. In no
case can he take an active part.</p>

<p>After the men of the totem have assembled, they leave the
camp, leaving only two or three of their number behind. They
advance in a profound silence, one behind another, all naked,
without arms and without any of their habitual ornaments.
Their attitude and their pace are marked with a religious
gravity: this is because the act in which they are taking part
has an exceptional importance in their eyes. Also, until the
end of the ceremony they are required to observe a rigorous
fast.</p>

<p>The country which they traverse is all filled with souvenirs
left by the glorious ancestors. Thus they arrive at a spot where
a huge block of quartz is found, with small round stones all
around it. This block represents the witchetty grub as an adult.
The Alatunja strikes it with a sort of wooden tray called <i>apmara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and at the same time he intones a chant, whose object is to
invite the animal to lay eggs. He proceeds in the same fashion
with the stones which are regarded as the eggs of the animal
and with one of which he rubs the stomach of each assistant.
This done, they all descend a little lower, to the foot of a cliff
also celebrated in the myths of the Alcheringa, at the base of
which is another stone, also representing the witchetty grub.
The Alatunja strikes it with his apmara; the men accompanying
him do so as well, with branches of a gum-tree which they have
gathered on the way, all of which goes on in the midst of chants
renewing the invitation previously addressed to the animal.
About ten different spots are visited in turn, some of which are
a mile or more from the others. At each of them there is a
stone at the bottom of a cave or hole, which is believed to represent
the witchetty grub in one of his aspects or at one of the
phases of his existence, and upon each of these stones, the same
ceremonies are repeated.</p>

<p>The meaning of the rite is evident. When the Alatunja
strikes the sacred stones, it is to detach some dust. The grains
of this very holy dust are regarded as so many germs of life;
each of them contains a spiritual principle which will give birth
to a new being, when introduced into an organism of the same
species. The branches with which the assistants are provided
serve to scatter this precious dust in all directions; it is scattered
everywhere, to accomplish its fecundating work. By this means,
they assure, in their own minds, an abundant reproduction of the
animal species over which the clans guard, so to speak, and upon
which it depends.</p>

<p>The natives themselves give the rite this interpretation.
Thus, in the clan of the <i>ilpirla</i> (a kind of "manna"), they
proceed in the following manner. When the day of the Intichiuma
arrives, the group assembles near a huge rock, about
fifty feet high; on top of this rock is another, very similar to
the first in aspect and surrounded by other smaller ones. Both
represent masses of manna. The Alatunja digs up the ground
at the foot of this rock and uncovers a churinga which is believed
to have been buried there in Alcheringa times, and which is,
as it were, the quintessence of the manna. Then he climbs up
to the summit of the higher rock and rubs it, first with the
churinga and then with the smaller stones which surround it.
Finally, he brushes away the dust which has thus been collected
on the surface of the rock, with the branches of a tree; each of
the assistants does the same in his turn. Now Spencer and
Gillen say that the idea of the natives is that the dust thus
scattered will "settle upon the mulga trees and so produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
manna." In fact, these operations are accompanied by a hymn
sung by those present, in which this idea is expressed.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a></p>

<p>With variations, this same rite is found in other societies.
Among the Urabunna, there is a rock representing an ancestor
of the Lizard clan; bits are detached from it which they throw
in every direction, in order to secure an abundant production
of lizards.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> In this same tribe, there is a sand-bank which
mythological souvenirs closely associate with the louse totem.
At the same spot are two trees, one of which is called the ordinary
louse tree, the other, the crab-louse tree. They take some of
this sand, rub it on these trees, throw it about on every side
and become convinced that, as a result of this, lice will be born in
large numbers.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> The Mara perform the Intichiuma of the bees
by scattering dust detached from sacred rocks.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> For the
kangaroo of the plains, a slightly different method is used.
They take some kangaroo-dung and wrap it up in a certain
herb of which the animal is very fond, and which belongs to the
kangaroo totem for this reason. Then they put the dung, thus
enveloped, on the ground between two bunches of this herb
and set the whole thing on fire. With the flame thus made,
they light the branches of trees and then whirl them about in
such a way that sparks fly in every direction. These sparks
play the same r&ocirc;le as the dust in the preceding cases.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>In a certain number of clans,<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> men mix something of their
own substance with that of the stone, in order to make the
rite more efficacious. Young men open their veins and let streams
of blood flow on to the rock. This is the case, for example, in
the Intichiuma of the Hakea flower among the Arunta. The
ceremony takes place in a sacred place around an equally sacred
rock which, in the eyes of the natives, represents Hakea flowers.
After certain preliminary operations, "the old leader asks one
of the young men to open a vein in his arm, which he does,
and allows the blood to sprinkle freely, while the other men
continue the singing. The blood flows until the stone is completely
covered."<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> The object of this practice is to revivify
the virtues of the stone, after a fashion, and to reinforce its
efficacy. It should not be forgotten that the men of the clan are
relatives of the plant or animal whose name they bear; the
same principle of life is in them, and especially in their blood.
So it is only natural that one should use this blood and the mystic
germs which it carries to assure the regular reproduction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
totemic species. It frequently happens among the Arunta
that when a man is sick or tired, one of his young companions
opens his veins and sprinkles him with his blood in order to reanimate
him.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> If blood is able to reawaken life in a man in this
way, it is not surprising that it should also be able to awaken it
in the animal or vegetable species with which the men of the clan
are confounded.</p>

<p>The same process is employed in the Intichiuma of the Undiara
kangaroo among the Arunta. The theatre of the ceremony is a
water-hole vaulted over by a peaked rock. This rock represents
an animal-kangaroo of the Alcheringa which was killed and
deposited there by a man-kangaroo of the same epoch; many
kangaroo spirits are also believed to reside there. After a certain
number of sacred stones have been rubbed against each other
in the way we have described, several of the assistants climb up
on the rock upon which they let their blood flow.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> "The purpose
of the ceremony at the present day, so say the natives, is by
means of pouring out the blood of kangaroo men upon the rock,
to drive out in all directions the spirits of the kangaroo animals
and so to increase the number of the animals."<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>There is even one case among the Arunta where the blood
seems to be the active principle in the rite. In the Emu group,
they do not use sacred stones or anything resembling them.
The Alatunja and some of his assistants sprinkle the ground
with their blood; on the ground thus soaked, they trace lines
in various colours, representing the different parts of the body
of an emu. They kneel down around this design and chant a
monotonous hymn. From the fictitious emu to which this chant
is addressed, and, consequently, from the blood which has served
to make it, they believe that vivifying principles go forth, which
animate the embryos of the new generation, and thus prevent
the species from disappearing.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>Among the Wonkgongaru,<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> there is one clan whose totem
is a certain kind of fish; in the Intichiuma of this totem also,
it is the blood that plays the principal part. The chief of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
group, after being ceremoniously painted, goes into a pool of
water and sits down there. Then he pierces his scrotum and the
skin around his navel with small pointed bones. "The blood
from the wounds goes into the water and gives rise to fish."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>By a wholly similar process, the Dieri think that they assure
the reproduction of two of their totems, the carpet snake and the
woma snake (the ordinary snake). A Mura-mura named Minkani
is thought to live under a dune. His body is represented by some
fossil bones of animals or reptiles, such as the deltas of the rivers
flowing into Lake Eyre contain, according to Howitt. When
the day of the ceremony arrives, the men assemble and go to the
home of the Minkani. There they dig until they come to a
layer of damp earth which they call "the excrement of Minkani."
From now on, they continue to turn up the soil with great care
until they uncover "the elbow of Minkani." Then two young
men open their veins and let their blood flow on to the sacred
rock. They chant the hymn of Minkani while the assistants,
carried away in a veritable frenzy, beat each other with their
arms. The battle continues until they get back to the camp,
which is about a mile away. Here, the women intervene and
put an end to the combat. They collect the blood which has
flown from the wounds, mix it with the "excrement of Minkani,"
and scatter the resulting mixture over the dune. When this rite
has been accomplished, they are convinced that carpet snakes
will be born in abundance.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>In certain cases, they use the very substance which they wish
to produce as the vivifying principle. Thus among the Kaitish,
in the course of a ceremony whose object is to create rain, they
sprinkle water over a sacred rock which represents the mythical
heroes of the Water clan. It is evident that they believe that
by this means they augment the productive virtues of the rock
just as well as with blood, and for the same reasons.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Among
the Mara, the actor takes water from a sacred hole, puts it in his
mouth and spits it out in every direction.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> Among the Worgaia,
when the yams begin to sprout, the chief of the Yam clan sends
men of the phratry of which he is not a member himself to gather
some of these plants; these bring some to him, and ask him to
intervene, in order that the species may develop well. He takes
one, chews it, and throws the bits in every direction.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Among
the Kaitish when, after various rites which we shall not describe,
the grain of a certain grass called Erlipinna has reached its full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
development, the chief of the totem brings a little of it to camp
and grinds it between two stones; the dust thus obtained is
piously gathered up, and a few grains are placed on the lips
of the chief, who scatters them by blowing. This contact with
the mouth of the chief, which has a very special sacramental
virtue, undoubtedly has the object of stimulating the vitality
of the germs which these grains contain and which, being blown
to all the quarters of the horizon, go to communicate these
fecundating virtues which they possess to the plants.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>The efficacy of these rites is never doubted by the native:
he is convinced that they must produce the results he expects,
with a sort of necessity. If events deceive his hopes, he merely
concludes that they were counteracted by the sorcery of some
hostile group. In any case, it never enters his mind that a favourable
result could be obtained by any other means. If by chance
the vegetation grows or the animals produce before he has performed
his Intichiuma, he supposes that another Intichiuma
has been celebrated under the ground by the ancestors and that
the living reap the benefits of this subterranean ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>This is the first act of the celebration.</p>

<p>During the period immediately following, there are no regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
ceremonies. However, the religious life remains intense: this is
manifested especially by an aggravation of the system of interdicts.
It is as though the sacred character of the totem were reinforced:
they do not even dare to touch it. In ordinary times, the Arunta
may eat the animal or plant which serves as totem, provided
they do so with moderation, but on the morrow of the Intichiuma
this right is suspended; the alimentary interdiction is strict and
without exceptions. They believe that any violation of this
interdict would result in neutralizing the good effects of the rite
and in preventing the increase of the species. It is true that the
men of other totems who happen to be in the same locality are
not submitted to the same prohibition. However, their liberty
is less than ordinary at this time. They may not consume the
totemic animal wherever they place, in the brush, for example;
they must bring it to camp, and it is there only that it may be
cooked.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>A final ceremony terminates this period of extraordinary
interdictions and definitely closes this long series of rites. It
varies somewhat in different clans, but the essential elements
are the same everywhere. Here are the two principal forms
which it takes among the Arunta. One of these is in connection
with the witchetty grub, the other with the kangaroo.</p>

<p>When the grubs have attained full maturity and appear in
abundance, the men of the totem, as well as others, collect as
many of them as possible; then they all bring those they have
found back to camp and cook them until they become hard and
brittle. They are then preserved in wooden vessels called <i>pitchi</i>.
The harvest of grubs is possible only during a very short time,
for they appear only after the rain. When they begin to be less
numerous, the Alatunja summons everybody to the camp; on
his invitation, each one brings his supply. The others place
theirs before the men of that totem. The Alatunja takes one
of these <i>pitchi</i> and, with the aid of his companions, he grinds
its contents between two stones; after this, he eats a little of
the powder thus obtained, his assistants do the same, and what
remains is given to the men of the other clans, who may now
dispose of it freely. They proceed in exactly the same manner
with the supply provided by the Alatunja. From now on,
the men and women of the totem may eat it, but only a little at
a time; if they went beyond the limits allowed, they would lose
the powers necessary to celebrate the Intichiuma and the species
would not reproduce. Yet, if they did not eat any at all, and
especially if the Alatunja ate none in the circumstances we have
just described, they would be overtaken by the same incapacity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>In the totemic group of the Kangaroo, which has its centre at
Undiara, certain characteristics of the ceremony are more clearly
marked. After the rites which we have described have been
accomplished on the sacred rock, the young men go and hunt
the kangaroo, bringing their game back to the camp. Here,
the old men, with the Alatunja in their midst, eat a little of the
flesh of the animal, and anoint the bodies of those who took
part in the Intichiuma with its fat. The rest is divided up among
the men assembled. Next, the men of the totem decorate
themselves with totemic designs and the night is passed in
songs commemorating the exploits accomplished by men and
animal kangaroos in the times of the Alcheringa. The next day,
the young men go hunting again in the forest and bring back
a larger number of kangaroos than the first time, and the ceremonies
of the day before recommence.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>With variations of detail, the same rite is found in other
Arunta clans,<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> among the Urabunna,<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> the Kaitish,<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> the Unmatjera,<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
and in the Encounter Bay Tribe.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Everywhere, it is
made up of the same essential elements. A few specimens of the
totemic animal or plant are presented to the chief of the clan,
who solemnly eats them and who must eat them. If he did not
fulfil this duty, he would lose the power of celebrating the Intichiuma
efficaciously, that is to say, so as to recreate the species
annually. Sometimes the ritual consumption is followed by
an unction made with the fat of the animal or certain parts of
the plant.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> This rite is generally repeated by the men of the
totem, or at least by the old men, and after it has been accomplished,
the exceptional interdictions are raised.</p>

<p>In the tribes located farther north, among the Warramunga
and neighbouring societies,<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> this ceremony is no longer found.
However, traces are found which seem to indicate that there
was a time when it was known. It is true that the chief of the
clan never eats the totem ritually and obligatorily. But in certain
cases, men who are not of the totem whose Intichiuma has just
been celebrated, must bring the animal or plant to camp and
offer it to the chief, asking him if he wants to eat it. He refuses
and adds, "I have made this for you; you may eat it freely."<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
So the custom of the presentation remains and the question asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of the chief seems to date back to an epoch when the ritual consumption
was practised.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The interest of the system of rites which has just been described
lies in the fact that in them we find, in the most elementary
form that is actually known, all the essential principles of a
great religious institution which was destined to become one of
the foundation stones of the positive cult in the superior religions:
this is the institution of sacrifice.</p>

<p>We know what a revolution the work of Robertson Smith
brought about in the traditional theory of sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> Before
him, sacrifice was regarded as a sort of tribute or homage, either
obligatory or optional, analogous to that which subjects owe to
their princes. Robertson Smith was the first to remark that
this classic explanation did not account for two essential characteristics
of the rite. In the first place, it is a repast: its substance
is food. Secondly, it is a repast in which the worshippers who
offer it take part, along with the god to whom it is offered. Certain
parts of the victim are reserved for the divinity; others are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
attributed to the sacrificers, who consume them; this is why
the Bible often speaks of the sacrifice as a repast in the presence
of Jahveh. Now in a multitude of societies, meals taken in
common are believed to create a bond of artificial kinship
between those who assist at them: In fact, relatives are people
who are naturally made of the same flesh and blood. But food
is constantly remaking the substance of the organism. So a
common food may produce the same effects as a common origin.
According to Smith, sacrificial banquets have the object of
making the worshipper and his god communicate in the same
flesh, in order to form a bond of kinship between them. From
this point of view, sacrifice takes on a wholly new aspect. Its
essential element is no longer the act of renouncement which
the word sacrifice ordinarily expresses; before all, it is an act
of alimentary communion.</p>

<p>Of course there are some reservations to be made in the details
of this way of explaining the efficacy of sacrificial banquets.
This does not result exclusively from the act of eating together.
A man does not sanctify himself merely by sitting down, in
some way, at the same table with a god, but especially by eating
food at this ritual repast which has a sacred character. It has
been shown how a whole series of preliminary operations, lustrations,
unctions, prayers, etc., transform the animal to be immolated
into a sacred thing, whose sacredness is subsequently
transferred to the worshipper who eats it.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> But it is true, none
the less, that the alimentary communion is one of the essential
elements of the sacrifice. Now when we turn to the rite which
terminates the ceremonies of the Intichiuma, we find that it,
too, consists in an act of this sort. After the totemic animal
has been killed, the Alatunja and the old men solemnly eat it.
So they communicate with the sacred principle residing in it
and they assimilate it. The only difference we find here is that
the animal is naturally sacred while it ordinarily acquires this
character artificially in the course of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Moreover, the object of this communion is manifest. Every
member of a totemic clan contains a mystic substance within
him which is the pre-eminent part of his being, for his soul
is made out of it. From it come whatever powers he has and
his social position, for it is this which makes him a person. So
he has a vital interest in maintaining it intact and in keeping it,
as far as is possible, in a state of perpetual youth. Unfortunately
all forces, even the most spiritual, are used up in the course of
time if nothing comes to return to them the energy they lose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
through the normal working of things; there is a necessity of
the first importance here which, as we shall see, is the real reason
for the positive cult. Therefore the men of a totem cannot
retain their position unless they periodically revivify the totemic
principle which is in them; and as they represent this principle
in the form of a vegetable or animal, it is to the corresponding
animal or vegetable species that they go to demand the supplementary
forces needed to renew this and to rejuvenate it.
A man of the Kangaroo clan believes himself and feels himself
a kangaroo; it is by this quality that he defines himself; it is
this which marks his place in the society. In order to keep it, he
takes a little of the flesh of this same animal into his own body
from time to time. A small bit is enough, owing to the rule:
<i>the part is equal to the whole</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></p>

<p>If this operation is to produce all the desired effects, it may
not take place at no matter what moment. The most opportune
time is when the new generation has just reached its complete
development, for this is also the moment when the forces
animating the totemic species attain their maximum intensity.
They have just been drawn with great difficulty from those rich
reservoirs of life, the sacred trees and rocks. Moreover, all
sorts of means have been employed to increase their intensity
still more; this is the use of the rites performed during the first
part of the Intichiuma. Also, by their very aspect, the firstfruits
of the harvest manifest the energy which they contain: here the
totemic god acclaims himself in all the glory of his youth. This
is why the firstfruits have always been regarded as a very
sacred fruit, reserved for very holy beings. So it is natural that
the Australian uses it to regenerate himself spiritually. Thus
both the date and the circumstances of the ceremonies are
explained.</p>

<p>Perhaps some will be surprised that so sacred a food may
be eaten by ordinary profane persons. But in the first place,
there is no positive cult which does not face this contradiction.
Every sacred being is removed from profane touch by this very
character with which it is endowed; but, on the other hand,
they would serve for nothing and have no reason whatsoever
for their existence if they could not come in contact with these
same worshippers who, on another ground, must remain respectfully
distant from them. At bottom, there is no positive rite
which does not constitute a veritable sacrilege, for a man cannot
hold commerce with the sacred beings without crossing the
barrier which should ordinarily keep them separate. But the
important thing is that the sacrilege should be accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
with precautions which attenuate it. Among those employed,
the most usual one consists in arranging the transition so as
to introduce the worshipper slowly and gradually into the
circle of sacred things. When it has been broken and diluted
in this fashion, the sacrilege does not offend the religious conscience
so violently; it is not regarded as a sacrilege and so
vanishes. This is what happens in the case now before us.
The effect of the whole series of rites which has preceded the
moment when the totem is solemnly eaten has been to sanctify
those who took an active part in them. They constitute an
essentially religious period, through which no one could go without
a transformation of his religious state. The fasts, the contact
with sacred rocks, the churinga,<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> the totemic decorations, etc.,
have gradually conferred upon him a character which he did not
have before and which enables him to approach, without a shocking
and dangerous profanation, this desirable and redoubtable
food which is forbidden him in ordinary times.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p>If the act by which a sacred being is first immolated and then
eaten by those who adore it may be called a sacrifice, the rite
of which we have just been speaking has a right to this same
name. Moreover, its significance is well shown by the striking
analogies it presents with so many practices met with in a large
number of agrarian cults. It is a very general rule that even
among peoples who have attained a high degree of civilization,
the firstfruits of the harvest are used in the ritual repasts, of
which the pascal feast is the best known example.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> On the
other hand, as the agrarian rites are at the very basis of the
most advanced forms of the cult, we see that the Intichiuma
of the Australian societies is closer to us than one might imagine
from its apparent crudeness.</p>

<p>By an intuition of genius, Smith had an intuition of all this,
though he was not acquainted with the facts. By a series of
ingenious deductions&mdash;which need not be reproduced here, for
their interest is now only historical<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>&mdash;he thought that he could
establish the fact that at the beginning the animal immolated in
the sacrifice must have been regarded as quasi-divine and as a
close relative of those who immolated it: now these characteristics
are just the ones with which the totemic species is defined.
Smith even went so far as to suppose that totemism must have
known and practised a rite wholly similar to the one we have
been studying; he was even inclined to see the original source<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
of the whole sacrificial institution in a sacrifice of this sort.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>
Sacrifice was not founded to create a bond of artificial kinship
between a man and his gods, but to maintain and renew the
natural kinship which primitively united them. Here, as elsewhere,
the artifice was born only to imitate nature. But in the
book of Smith this hypothesis was presented as scarcely more
than a theory which the then known facts supported very
imperfectly. The rare cases of totemic sacrifice which he cites
in support of his theory do not have the significance he attributed
to them; the animals which figure in them are not real totems.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
But to-day we are able to state that on at least one point the
demonstration is made: in fact, we have just seen that in an
important number of societies the totemic sacrifice, such as
Smith conceived it, is or has been practised. Of course, we have
no proof that this practice is necessarily inherent to totemism
or that it is the germ out of which all the other types of sacrifices
have developed. But if the universality of the rite is hypothetical,
its existence is no longer to be contested. Hereafter it is to be
regarded as established that the most mystical form of the
alimentary communion is found even in the most rudimentary
cults known to-day.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>But on another point the new facts at our disposal invalidate
the theories of Smith.</p>

<p>According to him, the communion was not only an essential
element of the sacrifice, but at the beginning, at least, it was the
unique element. Not only is one mistaken when he reduces
sacrifice to nothing more than a tribute or offering, but the very
idea of an offering was originally absent from it; this intervened
only at a late period and under the influence of external circumstances;
so instead of being able to aid us in understanding it,
it has rather masked the real nature of the ritual mechanism.
In fact, Smith claimed to find in the very notion of oblation an
absurdity so revolting that it could never have been the fundamental
reason for so great an institution. One of the most
important functions incumbent upon the divinity is to assure to
men that food which is necessary for life; so it seems impossible
that the sacrifice, in its turn, should consist in a presentation of
food to the divinity. It even seems self-contradictory that the
gods should expect their food from a man, when it is from them
that he gets his. Why should they have need of his aid in order
to deduct beforehand their just share of the things which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
receives from their hands? From these considerations Smith
concluded that the idea of a sacrifice-offering could have been
born only in the great religions, where the gods, removed from
the things with which they were primitively confused, were
thought of as sorts of kings and the eminent proprietors of the
earth and its products. From this moment onwards, the sacrifice
was associated with the tribute which subjects paid to their
prince, as a price of the rights which were conceded to them.
But this new interpretation was really an alteration and even
a corruption of the primitive conception. For "the idea of
property materializes all that it touches"; by introducing
itself into the sacrifice, it denatured it and made it into a sort of
bargain between the man and the divinity.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a></p>

<p>But the facts which we have described overthrow this argumentation.
These rites are certainly among the most primitive
that have ever been observed. No determined mythical personality
appears in them; there is no question of gods or spirits
that are properly so called; it is only vaguely anonymous and
impersonal forces which they put into action. Yet the reasoning
which they suppose is exactly the one that Smith declared
impossible because of its absurdity.</p>

<p>Let us return to the first act of the Intichiuma, to the rites
destined to assure the fecundity of the animal or vegetable
species which serves the clan as totem. This species is the pre-eminently
sacred thing; in it is incarnated that which we have
been able to call, by metaphor, the totemic divinity. Yet we
have seen that to perpetuate itself it has need of the aid of men.
It is they who dispense the life of the new generation each year;
without them, it would never be born. If they stopped celebrating
the Intichiuma, the sacred beings would disappear from
the face of the earth. So in one sense, it is from men that they
get their existence; yet in another way, it is from them that
men get theirs; for after they have once arrived at maturity,
it is from them that men acquire the force needed to support and
repair their spiritual beings. Thus we are able to say that men
make their gods, or, at least, make them live; but at the same
time, it is from them that they live themselves. So they are
regularly guilty of the circle which, according to Smith, is implied
in the very idea of a sacrificial tribute: they give to the sacred
beings a little of what they receive from them, and they receive
from them all that they give.</p>

<p>But there is still more to be said: the oblations which he is
thus forced to make every year do not differ in nature from
those which are made later in the rites properly called sacrifices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
If the sacrificer immolates an animal, it is in order that the living
principles within it may be disengaged from the organism and go
to nourish the divinity. Likewise, the grains of dust which the
Australian detaches from the sacred rock are so many sacred
principles which he scatters into space, so that they may go to
animate the totemic species and assure its renewal. The gesture
with which this scattering is made is also that which normally
accompanies offerings. In certain cases, the resemblance between
the two rites may be followed even to the details of the movements
effected. We have seen that in order to have rain the
Kaitish pour water over the sacred stone; among certain
peoples, the priest pours water over the altar, with the same end
in view.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> The effusions of blood which are usual in a certain
number of Intichiuma are veritable oblations. Just as the
Arunta or Dieri sprinkle the sacred rock or the totemic design
with blood, so it frequently happens that in the more advanced
cults, the blood of the sacrificed victim or of the worshipper
himself is spilt before or upon the altar.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> In these cases, it is
given to the gods, of whom it is the preferred food; in Australia,
it is given to the sacred species. So we have no ground for
saying that the idea of oblation is a late product of civilization.</p>

<p>A document which we owe to Strehlow puts this kinship of
the Intichiuma and the sacrifice clearly into evidence. This is
a hymn which accompanies the Intichiuma of the Kangaroo;
the ceremony is described at the same time that its expected
effects are announced. A morsel of kangaroo fat has been placed
by the chief upon a support made of branches. The text says
that this fat makes the fat of the kangaroos increase.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> This time,
they do not confine themselves to sprinkling sacred dust or
human blood about; the animal itself is immolated, or sacrificed
as one might say, placed upon a sort of altar, and offered to the
species, whose life it should maintain.</p>

<p>Now we see the sense in which we may say that the Intichiuma
contains the germs of the sacrificial system. In the form which
it takes when fully constituted, a sacrifice is composed of two
essential elements: an act of communion and an act of oblation.
The worshipper communes with his god by taking in a sacred
food, and at the same time he makes an offering to this god.
We find these two acts in the Intichiuma, as we have described
it. The only difference is that in the ordinary sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
made simultaneously or else follow one another immediately,
while in the Australian ceremony they are separated. In the
former case, they are parts of one undivided rite; here, they
take place at different times, and may even be separated by a
rather long interval. But, at bottom, the mechanism is the same.
Taken as a whole, the Intichiuma is a sacrifice, but one whose
parts are not yet articulated and organized.</p>

<p>The relating of these two ceremonies has the double advantage
of enabling us to understand better the nature of the Intichiuma
and that of sacrifice.</p>

<p>We understand the Intichiuma better. In fact, the conception
of Frazer, which made it a simple magic operation<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> with no
religious character at all, is now seen to be unsupportable. One
cannot dream of excluding from religion a rite which is the
forerunner of so great a religious institution.</p>

<p>But we also understand what the sacrifice itself is better.
In the first place, the equal importance of the two elements
entering into it is now established. If the Australian makes
offerings to his sacred beings, there is no reason for supposing
that the idea of oblation was foreign to the primitive organization
of the sacrificial institution and later upset its natural arrangement.
The theory of Smith must be revised on this point.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>
Of course the sacrifice is partially a communion; but it is also,
and no less essentially, a gift and an act of renouncement. It
always presupposes that the worshipper gives some of his substance
or his goods to his gods. Every attempt to deduce one
of these elements from the other is hopeless. Perhaps the
oblation is even more permanent than the communion.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></p>

<p>In the second place, it ordinarily seems as though the sacrifice,
and especially the sacrificial oblation, could only be addressed
to personal beings. But the oblations which we have met with
in Australia imply no notion of this sort. In other words, the
sacrifice is independent of the varying forms in which the religious
forces are conceived; it is founded upon more profound reasons,
which we shall seek presently.</p>

<p>In any case, it is clear that the act of offering naturally arouses
in the mind the idea of a moral subject, whom this offering is
destined to please. The ritual acts which we have described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
become more intelligible when it is believed that they are
addressed to persons. So the practices of the Intichiuma, while
actually putting only impersonal forces into play, prepare the
way for a different conception.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> Of course they were not sufficient
to form the idea of mythical personalities by themselves, but
when this idea had once been formed, the very nature of these
rites made it enter into the cult; thus, taking a more direct
interest in action and life, it also acquired a greater reality.
So we are even able to believe that the cult favoured, in a
secondary manner, no doubt, but nevertheless one which is
worthy of attention, the personification of the religious forces.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>But we still have to explain the contradiction in which
Robertson Smith saw an inadmissible logical scandal.</p>

<p>If the sacred beings always manifested their powers in a
perfectly equal manner, it would appear inconceivable that men
should dream of offering them services, for we cannot see what
need they could have of them. But in the first place, in so far
as they are confused with things, and in so far as they are regarded
as principles of the cosmic life, they are themselves submitted to
the rhythm of this life. Now this goes in oscillations in contrary
directions, which succeed one another according to a determined
law. Sometimes it is affirmed in all its glory; sometimes it
weakens to such an extent that one may ask himself whether it
is not going to fade away. Vegetation dies every year; will it
be reborn? Animal species tend to become extinguished by the
effect of natural and violent death; will they be renewed at
such a time and in such a way as is proper? Above all, the rain
is capricious; there are long periods during which it seems to
have disappeared for ever. These periodical variations of nature
bear witness to the fact that at the corresponding periods, the
sacred beings upon whom the plants, animals, rain, etc., depend
are themselves passing through grave crises; so they, too, have
their periods of giving way. But men could not regard these
spectacles as indifferent spectators. If he is to live, the universal
life must continue, and consequently the gods must not die.
So he seeks to sustain and aid them; for this, he puts at their
service whatever forces he has at his disposition, and mobilizes
them for this purpose. The blood flowing in his veins has
fecundating virtues; he pours it forth. From the sacred rocks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
possessed by his clan he takes those germs of life which lie
dormant there, and scatters them into space. In a word, he
makes oblations.</p>

<p>The external and physical crises, moreover, duplicate internal
and mental crises which tend toward the same result. Sacred
beings exist only when they are represented as such in the
mind. When we cease to believe in them, it is as though they
did not exist. Even those which have a material form and are
given by sensible experience, depend upon the thought of the
worshippers who adore them; for the sacred character which
makes them objects of the cult is not given by their natural
constitution; it is added to them by belief. The kangaroo is
only an animal like all others; yet, for the men of the Kangaroo,
it contains within it a principle which puts it outside the company
of others, and this principle exists only in the minds of those
who believe in it.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> If these sacred beings, when once conceived,
are to have no need of men to continue, it would be necessary
that the representations expressing them always remain the
same. But this stability is impossible. In fact, it is in the communal
life that they are formed, and this communal life is
essentially intermittent. So they necessarily partake of this
same intermittency. They attain their greatest intensity at
the moment when the men are assembled together and are in
immediate relations with one another, when they all partake of
the same idea and the same sentiment. But when the assembly
has broken up and each man has returned to his own peculiar
life, they progressively lose their original energy. Being covered
over little by little by the rising flood of daily experiences, they
would soon fall into the unconscious, if we did not find some
means of calling them back into consciousness and revivifying
them. If we think of them less forcefully, they amount to less
for us and we count less upon them; they exist to a lesser degree.
So here we have another point of view, from which the services
of men are necessary to them. This second reason for their
existence is even more important than the first, for it exists all
the time. The intermittency of the physical life can affect
religious beliefs only when religions are not yet detached from
their cosmic basis. The intermittency of the social life, on the
other hand, is inevitable; even the most idealistic religions
cannot escape it.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is owing to this state of dependency upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
thought of men, in which the gods find themselves, that the
former are able to believe in the efficacy of their assistance.
The only way of renewing the collective representations which
relate to sacred beings is to retemper them in the very source
of the religious life, that is to say, in the assembled groups.
Now the emotions aroused by these periodical crises through
which external things pass induce the men who witness them
to assemble, to see what should be done about it. But by the
very fact of uniting, they are mutually comforted; they find
a remedy because they seek it together. The common faith
becomes reanimated quite naturally in the heart of this reconstituted
group; if is born again because it again finds those
very conditions in which it was born in the first place. After it
has been restored, it easily triumphs over all the private doubts
which may have arisen in individual minds. The image of the
sacred things regains power enough to resist the internal or
external causes which tended to weaken it. In spite of their
apparent failure, men can no longer believe that the gods will
die, because they feel them living in their own hearts. The
means employed to succour them, howsoever crude these may
be, cannot appear vain, for everything goes on as if they were
really effective. Men are more confident because they feel
themselves stronger; and they really are stronger, because
forces which were languishing are now reawakened in the consciousness.</p>

<p>So we must be careful not to believe, along with Smith, that
the cult was founded solely for the benefit of men and that
the gods have nothing to do with it: they have no less need
of it than their worshippers. Of course men would be unable
to live without gods, but, on the other hand, the gods would die
if their cult were not rendered. This does not have the sole
object of making profane subjects communicate with sacred
beings, but it also keeps these latter alive and is perpetually
remaking and regenerating them. Of course it is not the material
oblations which bring about this regeneration by their own
virtues; it is the mental states which these actions, though
vain in themselves, accompany or reawaken. The real reason
for the existence of the cults, even of those which are the most
materialistic in appearance, is not to be sought in the acts which
they prescribe, but in the internal and moral regeneration
which these acts aid in bringing about. The things which the
worshipper really gives his gods are not the foods which he
places upon the altars, nor the blood which he lets flow from his
veins: it is his thought. Nevertheless, it is true that there is an
exchange of services, which are mutually demanded, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the divinity and its worshippers. The rule <i>do ut des</i>, by which
the principle of sacrifice has sometimes been defined, is not a
late invention of utilitarian theorists: it only expresses in an
explicit way the very mechanism of the sacrificial system and,
more generally, of the whole positive cult. So the circle pointed
out by Smith is very real; but it contains nothing humiliating
for the reason. It comes from the fact that the sacred beings,
though superior to men, can live only in the human consciousness.</p>

<p>But this circle will appear still more natural to us, and we
shall understand its meaning and the reason for its existence
still better if, carrying our analysis still farther and substituting
for the religious symbols the realities which they represent,
we investigate how these behave in the rite. If, as we have
attempted to establish, the sacred principle is nothing more
nor less than society transfigured and personified, it should
be possible to interpret the ritual in lay and social terms. And,
as a matter of fact, social life, just like the ritual, moves in a
circle. On the one hand, the individual gets from society the
best part of himself, all that gives him a distinct character and
a special place among other beings, his intellectual and moral
culture. If we should withdraw from men their language, sciences,
arts and moral beliefs, they would drop to the rank of animals.
So the characteristic attributes of human nature come from
society. But, on the other hand, society exists and lives only
in and through individuals. If the idea of society were
extinguished in individual minds and the beliefs, traditions
and aspirations of the group were no longer felt and shared
by the individuals, society would die. We can say of it what
we just said of the divinity: it is real only in so far as it has a
place in human consciousnesses, and this place is whatever one
we may give it. We now see the real reason why the gods cannot
do without their worshippers any more than these can do without
their gods; it is because society, of which the gods are only a
symbolic expression, cannot do without individuals any more
than these can do without society.</p>

<p>Here we touch the solid rock upon which all the cults are
built and which has caused their persistence ever since human
societies have existed. When we see what religious rites consist
of and towards what they seem to tend, we demand with astonishment
how men have been able to imagine them, and especially
how they can remain so faithfully attached to them. Whence
could the illusion have come that with a few grains of sand
thrown to the wind, or a few drops of blood shed upon a rock
or the stone of an altar, it is possible to maintain the life of an
animal species or of a god? We have undoubtedly made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
step in advance towards the solution of this problem when we
have discovered, behind these outward and apparently unreasonable
movements, a mental mechanism which gives them a meaning
and a moral significance. But we are in no way assured that
this mechanism itself does not consist in a simple play of
hallucinatory images. We have pointed out the psychological
process which leads the believers to imagine that the rite causes
the spiritual forces of which they have need to be reborn about
them; but it does not follow from the fact that this belief
is psychologically explicable that it has any objective value.
If we are to see in the efficacy attributed to the rites anything
more than the product of a chronic delirium with which humanity
has abused itself, we must show that the effect of the cult really
is to recreate periodically a moral being upon which we depend
as it depends upon us. Now this being does exist: it is society.</p>

<p>Howsoever little importance the religious ceremonies may
have, they put the group into action; the groups assemble
to celebrate them. So their first effect is to bring individuals
together, to multiply the relations between them and to make
them more intimate with one another. By this very fact, the
contents of their consciousnesses is changed. On ordinary
days, it is utilitarian and individual avocations which take the
greater part of the attention. Every one attends to his own
personal business; for most men, this primarily consists in
satisfying the exigencies of material life, and the principal
incentive to economic activity has always been private interest.
Of course social sentiments could never be totally absent. We
remain in relations with others; the habits, ideas and tendencies
which education has impressed upon us and which ordinarily
preside over our relations with others, continue to make their
action felt. But they are constantly combated and held in
check by the antagonistic tendencies aroused and supported by
the necessities of the daily struggle. They resist more or less
successfully, according to their intrinsic energy: but this energy
is not renewed. They live upon their past, and consequently
they would be used up in the course of time, if nothing returned
to them a little of the force that they lose through these incessant
conflicts and frictions. When the Australians, scattered in
little groups, spend their time in hunting and fishing, they lose
sight of what concerns their clan or tribe: their only thought
is to catch as much game as possible. On feast days, on the
contrary, these preoccupations are necessarily eclipsed; being
essentially profane, they are excluded from these sacred periods.
At this time, their thoughts are centred upon their common
beliefs, their common traditions, the memory of their great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
ancestors, the collective ideal of which they are the incarnation;
in a word, upon social things. Even the material interests which
these great religious ceremonies are designed to satisfy concern
the public order and are therefore social. Society as a whole
is interested that the harvest be abundant, that the rain fall
at the right time and not excessively, that the animals reproduce
regularly. So it is society that is in the foreground of every
consciousness; It dominates and directs all conduct; this is
equivalent to saying that it is more living and active, and consequently
more real, than in profane times. So men do not
deceive themselves when they feel at this time that there is something
outside of them which is born again, that there are forces
which are reanimated and a life which reawakens. This renewal
is in no way imaginary and the individuals themselves profit
from it. For the spark of a social being which each bears within
him necessarily participates in this collective renovation. The
individual soul is regenerated too, by being dipped again in the
source from which its life comes; consequently it feels itself
stronger, more fully master of itself, less dependent upon physical
necessities.</p>

<p>We know that the positive cult naturally tends to take periodic
forms; this is one of its distinctive features. Of course there
are rites which men celebrate occasionally, in connection with
passing situations. But these episodic practices are always
merely accessory, and in the religions studied in this book,
they are almost exceptional. The essential constituent of the
cult is the cycle of feasts which return regularly at determined
epochs. We are now able to understand whence this tendency
towards periodicity comes; the rhythm which the religious life
follows only expresses the rhythm of the social life, and results
from it. Society is able to revivify the sentiment it has of itself
only by assembling. But it cannot be assembled all the time.
The exigencies of life do not allow it to remain in congregation
indefinitely; so it scatters, to assemble anew when it again feels
the need of this. It is to these necessary alternations that the
regular alternations of sacred and profane times correspond.
Since the apparent object, at least, of the cult was at first to
regularize the course of natural phenomena, the rhythm of the
cosmic life has put its mark on the rhythm of the ritual life.
This is why the feasts have long been associated with the seasons;
we have seen this characteristic already in the Intichiuma of
Australia. But the seasons have only furnished the outer
frame-work for this organization, and not the principle upon
which it rests; for even the cults which aim at exclusively
spiritual ends have remained periodical. So this periodicity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
must be due to other causes. Since the seasonal changes are
critical periods for nature, they are a natural occasion for
assembling, and consequently for religious ceremonies. But
other events can and have successfully fulfilled this function
of occasional cause. However, it must be recognized that this
frame-work, though purely external, has given proof of a singular
resistive force, for traces of it are found even in the religions
which are the most fully detached from all physical bases. Many
Christian celebrations are founded, with no break of continuity,
on the pastoral and agrarian feasts of the ancient Hebrews,
although in themselves they are neither pastoral nor agrarian.</p>

<p>Moreover, this rhythm is capable of varying in different
societies. Where the period of dispersion is long, and the dispersion
itself is extreme, the period of congregation, in its turn,
is very prolonged, and produces veritable debauches of collective
and religions life. Feasts succeed one another for weeks or even
for months, while the ritual life sometimes attains to a sort
of frenzy. This is what happens among the Australian tribes
and many of the tribes of North-western America.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> Elsewhere,
on the contrary, these two phases of the social life succeed one
another after shorter intervals, and then the contrast between
them is less marked. The more societies develop, the less they
seem to allow of too great intermittences.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER III</b><br /><br />

<small>THE POSITIVE CULT&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

II.&mdash;<i>Imitative Rites and the Principle of Causality</i></h3>


<p>But the processes which we have just been describing are
not the only ones employed to assure the fecundity of
the totemic species. There are others which serve for the same
end, whether they accompany the preceding ones or replace
them.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>In the very ceremonies which we have been describing, in
addition to the oblations, whether bloody or otherwise, there
are other rites which are frequently celebrated, whose object
is to complete the former ones and to consolidate their effects.
They consist in movements and cries whose object is to imitate
the different attitudes and aspects of the animal whose reproduction
is desired; therefore, we shall call them <i>imitative</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the Intichiuma of the Witchetty grub among the Arunta
includes more than the rites performed upon the sacred rocks,
of which we have already spoken. When these are finished,
the men set out to return to camp; but when they still are
about a mile away, they halt and all decorate themselves ritually;
after this, the march is resumed. The decorations with which
they thus adorn themselves announce that an important ceremony
is going to take place. And, in fact, while the company was
absent, one of the old men who had been left to guard the camp
had built a shelter out of branches, called <i>Umbana</i>, which represented
the chrysalis out of which the insect comes. All of those
who had taken part in the previous ceremonies assemble near
the spot where this construction has been raised; then they
advance slowly, stopping from time to time, until they reach the
<i>Umbana</i>, which they enter. At once all the men who do not
belong to the phratry of the Witchetty grub totem, and who
assist at the scene, though from a distance, lie down on the
ground, with their faces against the earth; they must remain
in this position without moving until they are allowed to get up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
again. Meanwhile, a chant arises from the interior of the Umbana,
which describes the different phases through which the animal
passes in the course of its development, and the myths of which
the sacred rocks are the subject. When this hymn ceases, the
Alatunja glides out of the <i>Umbana</i>, though remaining in a
squatting position, and advances slowly over the ground before
him; he is followed by all his companions who reproduce
gestures whose evident object is to represent the insect as it
leaves the chrysalis. Also, a hymn which is heard at just this
moment and which is like an oral commentary on the rite, consists
in a description of the movements made by the insect at this
stage of its development.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>Another Intichiuma,<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> celebrated in connection with another
kind of grub, the <i>unchalka</i><a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> grub, has this character still more
clearly. The actors of this rite decorate themselves with designs
representing the <i>unchalka</i> bush upon which this grub lives at
the beginning of its existence. Then they cover a buckler
with concentric circles of down, representing another kind of
bush upon which the insect lays its eggs when it has become
adult. When all these preparations are finished, they all sit
down on the ground in a semicircle facing the principal officiant.
He alternately bends his body double by leaning towards the
ground and then rises on his knees; at the same time, he shakes
his stretched-out arms, which is a way of representing the wings
of the insect. From time to time, he leans over the buckler,
imitating the way in which the butterfly flies over the trees
where it lays its eggs. When this ceremony is finished, another
commences at a different spot, to which they go in silence.
This time they use two bucklers. Upon one the tracks of the
grub are represented by zigzag lines; upon the other, concentric
circles of uneven dimensions represent the eggs of the insect and
the seed of the Eremophile bush, upon which it is nourished.
As in the former ceremony, they all sit down in silence while
the officiant acts, representing the movements of the animal
when leaving its chrysalis and taking its first flight.</p>

<p>Spencer and Gillen also point out certain analogous facts
among the Arunta, though these are of a minor importance:
in the Intichiuma of the Emu, for example, at a certain moment
the actors try to reproduce by their attitude the air and aspect
of this bird;<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> in the Intichiuma of water, the men of the totem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
utter the characteristic cry of the plover, a cry which is naturally
associated in the mind with the rainy season.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> But in all, the
examples of imitative rites which these two explorers have
noted are rather few in number. However, it is certain that
their relative silence on this point is due either to their not having
observed the Intichiuma sufficiently or else to their having
neglected this side of the ceremonies; Schulze, on the other
hand, has been struck by the essentially imitative nature of the
Arunta rites. "The sacred corrobbori," he says, "are generally
ceremonies representing animals": he calls them <i>animal tjurunga</i><a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>
and his testimony is now confirmed by the documents collected
by Strehlow. The examples given by this latter author are so
numerous that it is impossible to cite them all: there are scarcely
any ceremonies in which some imitating gesture is not pointed
out. According to the nature of the animals whose feast is
celebrated, they jump after the manner of kangaroos, or imitate
the movements they make in eating, the flight of winged ants,
the characteristic noise of the bat, the cry of the wild turkey,
the hissing of the snake, the croaking of the frog, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> When
the totem is a plant, they make the gesture of plucking it,<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> or
eating it,<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> etc.</p>

<p>Among the Warramunga, the Intichiuma generally takes a
special form, which we shall describe in the next chapter and
which differs from those which we have studied up to the present.
However, there is one typical case of a purely imitative Intichiuma
among this people; it is that of the black cockatoo.
The ceremony described by Spencer and Gillen commenced
at ten o'clock in the evening. All night long the chief of the clan
imitated the cry of the bird with a disheartening monotony.
He stopped only when he had come to the end of his force,
and then his son replaced him; then he commenced again as
soon as he felt a little refreshed. These exhausting exercises
continued until morning without interruption.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

<p>Living beings are not the only ones which they try to imitate.
In a large number of tribes, the Intichiuma of rain consists
essentially in imitative rites. One of the most simple of these is
that celebrated among the Arabunna. The chief of the clan is
seated on the ground, all covered with white down and holding
a lance in his hands. He shakes himself, undoubtedly in order
to detach from his body the down which is fixed there and which
represents clouds when scattered about in the air. Thus he
imitates the men-clouds of the Alcheringa who, according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
the legend, had the habit of ascending to heaven and forming
clouds there, from which the rain then fell. In a word, the
object of the whole rite is to represent the formation and ascension
of clouds, the bringers of rain.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a></p>

<p>The ceremony is much more complicated among the Kaitish.
We have already spoken of one of the means employed: the
officiant pours water over the sacred stones and himself. But
the action of this sort of oblation is reinforced by other rites.
The rainbow is considered to have a close connection with rain:
they say that it is its son and that it is always urged to appear
to make the rain stop. To make the rain fall, it is therefore
necessary that it should not appear; they believe that this
result can be obtained in the following manner. A design representing
a rainbow is made upon a buckler. They carry this
buckler to camp, taking care to keep it hidden from all eyes.
They are convinced that by making this image of the rainbow
invisible, they keep the rainbow itself from appearing. Meanwhile,
the chief of the clan, having beside him a <i>pitchi</i> full of
water, throws in all directions flakes of down which represent
clouds. Repeated imitations of the cry of the plover complete
this ceremony, which seems to have an especial gravity; for as
long as it lasts, all those who participate in it, either as actors
or assistants, may have no relations whatsoever with their wives;
they may not even speak to them.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a></p>

<p>The processes of figuration are different among the Dieri.
Rain is not represented by water, but by blood, which the men
cause to flow from their veins on to the assistants.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> At the same
time they throw handfuls of white down about, which represent
clouds. A hut has been constructed previously, in which they
now place two large stones representing piles of clouds, a sign of
rain. After they have been left there for a little while, they are
carried a little distance away and placed as high as possible in
the loftiest tree to be found; this is a way of making the clouds
mount into the sky. Powdered gypsum is then thrown into a
water-hole, for when he sees this, the rain spirit soon makes
the clouds appear. Finally all the men, young and old, assemble
around the hut and with heads lowered, they charge upon it;
they rush violently through it, repeating the operation several
times, until nothing remains of the whole construction except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the supporting posts. Then they fall upon these and shake
and pull at them until the whole thing has tumbled down. The
operation consisting in running through the hut is supposed to
represent clouds bursting; the tumbling down of the construction,
the fall of rain.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p>In the north-western tribes studied by Clement,<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> which
occupy the district included between the Fontescue and Fitzroy
rivers, certain ceremonies are celebrated whose object is exactly
the same as that of the Intichiuma of the Arunta, and which
seem to be, for the most part, essentially imitative.</p>

<p>These peoples give the name <i>tarlow</i> to certain piles of stones
which are evidently sacred, for, as we shall see, they are the
object of important rites. Every animal, every plant, and in
fact, every totem or sub-totem,<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> is represented by a <i>tarlow</i>
which a special clan<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> guards. The analogy between these
<i>tarlow</i> and the sacred rocks of the Arunta is easily seen.</p>

<p>When kangaroos, for example, become rare, the chief of
the clan to which the <i>tarlow</i> of the kangaroo belongs goes to
it with a certain number of companions. Here various rites
are performed, the chief of which consist in jumping around
the <i>tarlow</i> as kangaroos jump, in drinking as they drink and, in
a word, in imitating all their most characteristic movements.
The weapons used in hunting the animal have an important
part in these rites. They brandish them, throw them against
the stones, etc. When they are concerned for emus, they go to
the <i>tarlow</i> of the emu, and walk and run as these birds do. The
skill which the natives show in these imitations is, as it appears,
really remarkable.</p>

<p>Other <i>tarlow</i> are consecrated to plants, such as the cereals.
In this case, they imitate the actions of threshing and grinding
the grain. Since in ordinary life it is the women who are normally
charged with these tasks, it is also they who perform the rite, in
the midst of songs and dances.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>All these rites belong to the same type. The principle upon
which they rest is one of those at the basis of what is commonly
and incorrectly called sympathetic<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> magic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>These principles are ordinarily reduced to two.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>The first may be stated thus: <i>anything touching an object
also touches everything which has any relation of proximity or
unity whatsoever with this object</i>. Thus, whatever affects the
part also affects the whole; any action exercised over an individual
is transmitted to his neighbours, relatives and all those
to whom he is united in any way. All these cases are simple
applications of the law of contagion, which we have already
studied. A condition or a good or bad quality are communicated
contagiously from one subject to another who has some connection
with the former.</p>

<p>The second principle is ordinarily summed up in the formula:
<i>like produces like</i>. The representation of a being or condition
produces this being or condition. This is the maxim which
brings about the rites which we have just been describing, and
it is in them that we can best observe its characteristics. The
classical example of the magic charm, which is ordinarily given
as the typical application of this same precept, is much less
significant. The charm is, to a large extent, a simple phenomenon
of transfer. The idea of the image is associated in the mind
with that of the model; consequently the effects of an action
performed upon a statue are transmitted contagiously to the
person whose traits it reproduces. The function of the image is
for its original what that of a part is for the whole: it is an agent
of transmission. Therefore men think that they can obtain
the same result by burning the hair of the person whom they
wish to injure: the only difference between these two sorts
of operations is that in one, the communication is made through
similarity, while in the other it is by means of contiguity. It is
different with the rites which concern us. They suppose not
only the displacement of a given condition or quality, which
passes from one object into the other, but also the creation
of something entirely new. The mere act of representing the
animal gives birth to this animal and creates it; by imitating
the sound of wind or falling water, they cause clouds to form,
rain to fall, etc. Of course resemblance plays an important
part in each case, but not at all the same one. In a charm, it
only gives a special direction to the action exercised; it directs
in a certain way an action not originating in it. In the rites of
which we have just been speaking, it acts by itself and is directly
efficacious. So, in contradiction to the usual definitions, the
real difference between the two principles of the so-called
sympathetic magic and the corresponding practices is not that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
it is contiguity acts in one case and resemblance in the other,
but that in the former there is a simple contagious communication,
while there is production and creation in the latter.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a></p>

<p>The explanation of imitative rites therefore implies the
explanation of the second of these principles, and reciprocally.</p>

<p>We shall not tarry long to discuss the explanation proposed
by the anthropological school, and especially by Tylor and
Frazer. Just as in their attempts to account for the contagiousness
of a sacred character, they invoke the association of ideas.
"Hom&#339;opathic magic," says Frazer, who prefers this expression
to imitative magic, "is founded on the association of ideas by
similarity; contagious magic is founded on the association of
ideas by contiguity. Hom&#339;opathic magic commits the mistake
of assuming that things which resemble each other are the same."<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>
But this is a misunderstanding of the special nature of the
practices under discussion. On the one hand, the formula of
Frazer may be applied with some fitness to the case of charms;<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>
here, in fact, two distinct things are associated with each other,
owing to their partial resemblance: these are the image and
the model which it represents more or less systematically. But
in the imitative rites, which we have just been observing, the
image alone is given; as for the model, it does not exist, for the
new generation of the totemic species is as yet only a hope and
even an uncertain hope at that. So there could be no question
of association, whether correct or not; there is a real creation,
and we cannot see how the association of ideas could possibly
lead to a belief in this creation. How could the mere act of
representing the movements of an animal bring about the
certitude that this animal will be born, and born in abundance?</p>

<p>The general properties of human nature cannot explain such
special practices. So instead of considering the principle upon
which they rest in its general and abstract form, let us replace it
in the environment of which it is a part and where we have been
observing it, and let us connect it with the system of ideas and
sentiments which the above rites put into practice, and then we
shall be better able to perceive the causes from which it results.</p>

<p>The men who assemble on the occasion of these rites believe
that they are really animals or plants of the species whose name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
they bear. They feel within them an animal or vegetable nature,
and in their eyes, this is what constitutes whatever is the most
essential and the most excellent in them. So when they assemble,
their first movement ought to be to show each other this quality
which they attribute to themselves and by which they are
defined. The totem is their rallying sign; for this reason, as we
have seen, they design it upon their bodies; but it is no less
natural that they should seek to resemble it in their gestures,
their cries, their attitude. Since they are emus or kangaroos,
they comport themselves like the animals of the same name.
By this means, they mutually show one another that they are
all members of the same moral community and they become
conscious of the kinship uniting them. The rite does not limit
itself to expressing this kinship; it makes it or remakes it.
For it exists only in so far as it is believed in, and the effect of
all these collective demonstrations is to support the beliefs upon
which they are founded. Therefore, these leaps, these cries and
these movements of every sort, though bizarre and grotesque in
appearance, really have a profound and human meaning. The
Australian seeks to resemble his totem just as the faithful in more
advanced religions seek to resemble their God. For the one as
for the other, this is a means of communicating with the sacred
being, that is to say, with the collective ideal which this latter
symbolizes. This is an early form of the
&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#943;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8183;
&#952;&#949;&#8183;.</p>

<p>However, as this first reason is connected with the most
specialized portions of the totemic beliefs, the principle by which
like produces like should not have survived totemism, if this had
been the only one in operation. Now there is probably no
religion in which rites derived from it are not found. So another
reason must co-operate with this first one.</p>

<p>And, in fact, the ceremonies where we have seen it applied do not
merely have the very general object which we have just mentioned,
howsoever essential this may be; they also aim at a more
immediate and more conscious end, which is the assurance of
the reproduction of the totemic species. The idea of this necessary
reproduction haunts the minds of the worshippers: upon it
the forces of their attention and will are concentrated. Now a
single preoccupation cannot possess a group of men to this point
without being externalized in a material form. Since all think
of the animal or plant to whose destinies the clan is united, it is
inevitable that this common thought should not be manifested
outwardly by gestures,<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> and those naturally designated for this
office are those which represent this animal or plant in one of
its most characteristic attitudes; there are no other movements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
so close to the idea filling every mind, for these are an immediate
and almost automatic translation of it. So they make themselves
imitate the animal; they cry like it, they jump like it; they
reproduce the scenes in which they make daily use of the plant.
All these ways of representation are just so many means of
ostensibly showing the end towards which all minds are directed,
of telling the thing which they wish to realize, of calling it up
and of evoking it. And this need belongs to no one time, nor
does it depend upon the beliefs of any special religion; it is
essentially human. This is why, even in religions very far
removed from those we have been studying, the worshippers,
when assembled to ask their gods for some event which they
ardently desire, are forced to figure it. Of course, the word is
also a way of expressing it; but the gesture is no less natural;
it bursts out from the organism just as spontaneously; it even
precedes the word, or, in any case, accompanies it.</p>

<p>But if we can thus understand how the gestures acquired a
place in the ceremony, we still must explain the efficacy attributed
to them. If the Australian repeats them regularly each
new season, it is because he believes them essential to the success
of the rite. Where could he have gotten the idea that by
imitating an animal, one causes it to reproduce?</p>

<p>So manifest an error seems hardly intelligible so long as we
see in the rite only the material end towards which it seems to
aim. But we know that in addition to the effect which it is
thought to have on the totemic species, it also exercises a profound
influence over the souls of the worshippers who take part
in it. They take away with them a feeling of well-being, whose
causes they cannot clearly see, but which is well founded. They
feel that the ceremony is good for them; and, as a matter of fact,
they reforge their moral nature in it. How could this sort of
well-being fail to give them a feeling that the rite has succeeded,
that it has been what it set out to be, and that it has attained
the ends at which it was aimed? As the only end which was
consciously sought was the reproduction of the totemic species,
this seems to be assured by the means employed, the efficacy of
which is thus proven. Thus it comes about that men attribute
creative virtues to their gestures, which in themselves are vain.
The moral efficacy of the rite, which is real, leads to the belief in
its physical efficacy, which is imaginary; that of the whole, to
the belief in that of each part by itself. The truly useful effects
produced by the whole ceremony are like an experimental
justification of the elementary practices out of which it is made,
though in reality, all these practices are in no way indispensable
to its success. A certain proof, moreover, that they do not act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
by themselves is that they may be replaced by others, of a very
different nature, without any modification of the final result.
It appears that there are Intichiuma which include only oblations,
with no imitative rites; others are purely imitative, and include
no oblations. However, both are believed to have the same
efficacy. So if a price is attached to these various man&#339;uvres,
it is not because of their intrinsic value, but because they are
a part of a complex rite, whose utility as a whole is realized.</p>

<p>We are able to understand this state of mind all the easier
because we can still observe it about us. Especially among the
most cultivated peoples and environments, we frequently meet
with believers who, though having doubts as to the special
efficacy attributed by dogma to each rite considered separately,
still continue to participate in the cult. They are not sure
that the details of the prescribed observances are rationally
justifiable; but they feel that it would be impossible to free
oneself of them without falling into a moral confusion before
which they recoil. The very fact that in them the faith has lost
its intellectual foundations throws into eminence the profound
reasons upon which they rest. This is why the easy criticisms
to which an unduly simple rationalism has sometimes submitted
ritual prescriptions generally leave the believer indifferent: it
is because the true justification of religious practices does not lie
in the apparent ends which they pursue, but rather in the
invisible action which they exercise over the mind and in the
way in which they affect our mental status. Likewise, when
preachers undertake to convince, they devote much less attention
to establishing directly and by methodical proofs the truth of
any particular proposition or the utility of such and such an
observance, than to awakening or reawakening the sentiment
of the moral comfort attained by the regular celebration of the
cult. Thus they create a predisposition to belief, which precedes
proofs, which leads the mind to overlook the insufficiency of the
logical reasons, and which thus prepares it for the proposition
whose acceptance is desired. This favourable prejudice, this
impulse towards believing, is just what constitutes faith; and
it is faith which makes the authority of the rites, according to
the believer, whoever he may be, Christian or Australian. The
only superiority of the former is that he better accounts for the
psychological process from which his faith results; he knows
that "it is faith that saves."</p>

<p>It is because faith has this origin that it is, in a sense, "impermeable
to experience."<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> If the intermittent failures of the
Intichiuma do not shake the confidence of the Australian in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
rite, it is because he holds with all the strength of his soul to
these practices in which he periodically recreates himself; he
could not deny their principle without causing an upheaval of
his own being, which resists. But howsoever great this force
of resistance may be, it cannot radically distinguish religious
mentality from the other forms of human mentality, even those
which are the most habitually opposed to it. In this connection,
that of a scholar differs from the preceding only in degree. When
a scientific law has the authority of numerous and varied
experiments, it is against all method to renounce it too quickly
upon the discovery of a fact which seems to contradict it. It is
still necessary to make sure that the fact does not allow of a
single interpretation, and that it is impossible to account for it,
without abandoning the proposition which it seems to invalidate.
Now the Australian does not proceed otherwise when he attributes
the failure of the Intichiuma to some sorcery, or the
abundance of a premature crop to a mystic Intichiuma celebrated
in the beyond. He has all the more reason for not doubting his
rite on the belief in a contrary fact, since its value is, or seems
to be, established by a larger number of harmonizing facts. In
the first place, the moral efficacy of the ceremony is real and is
felt directly by all who participate in it; there is a constantly
renewed experience in it, whose importance no contradictory
experience can diminish. Also, the physical efficacy itself is
not unable to find an at least apparent confirmation in the data
of objective observation. As a matter of fact, the totemic species
normally does reproduce regularly; so in the great majority
of cases, everything happens just as if the ritual gestures really
did produce the effects expected of them. Failures are the
exception. As the rites, and especially those which are periodical,
demand nothing more of nature than that it follow its ordinary
course, it is not surprising that it should generally have the air
of obeying them. So if the believer shows himself indocile to
certain lessons of experience, he does so because of other experiences
which seem more demonstrative. The scholar does not do
otherwise; only he introduces more method.</p>


<p class="npara">So magic is not, as Frazer has held,<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> an original fact, of which
religion is only a derived form. Quite on the contrary, it was
under the influence of religious ideas that the precepts upon
which the art of the magician is based were established, and it
was only through a secondary extension that they were applied
to purely lay relations. Since all the forces of the universe
have been conceived on the model of the sacred forces, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
contagiousness inherent in the second was extended to the first,
and men have believed that all the properties of a body could be
transmitted contagiously. Likewise, when the principle according
to which like produces like had been established, in order to
satisfy certain religious needs, it detached itself from its ritual
origins to become, through a sort of spontaneous generalization,
a law of nature.<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> But in order to understand these fundamental
axioms of magic, they must be replaced in the religious atmosphere
in which they arose and which alone enables us to account
for them. When we regard them as the work of isolated individuals
or solitary magicians, we ask how they could ever have
occurred to the mind of man, for nothing in experience could
either suggest or verify them; and especially we do not explain
how so deceiving an art has been able to impose itself for so long
a time in the confidence of men. But this problem disappears
when we realize that the faith inspired by magic is only a
particular case of religious faith in general, and that it is
itself the product, at least indirectly, of a collective effervescence.
This is as much as to say that the use of the expression sympathetic
magic to designate the system of rites which we have
just been speaking is not very exact. There are sympathetic
rites, but they are not peculiar to magic; not only are they to be
found in religion, but it was from religion that magic received them.
So we only risk confusion when, by the name we give them, we have
the air of making them something which is specifically magic.</p>

<p>The results of our analysis thus attach themselves to
and confirm those attained by MM. Hubert and Mauss when
they studied magic directly.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> They have shown that this is
nothing more nor less than crude industry based on incomplete
science. Behind the mechanisms, purely laical in appearance,
which are used by the magician, they point out a background
of religious conceptions and a whole world of forces, the idea of
which has been taken by magic from religion. We are now able
to understand how it comes that magic is so full of religious
elements: it is because it was born of religion.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>But the principle which has just been set forth does not merely
have a function in the ritual; it is of direct interest for the theory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
of knowledge. In fact, it is a concrete statement of the law of
causality and, in all probability, one of the most primitive
statements of it which has ever existed. A full conception of
the causal relation is implied in the power thus attributed to the
like to produce the like; and this conception dominates primitive
thought, for it is the basis both of the practices of the cult
and the technique of the magician. So the origins of the precept
upon which the imitative rites depend are able to clarify those of
the principle of causality. The genesis of one should aid us in
understanding the genesis of the other. Now we have shown
how the former is a product of social causes: it was elaborated
by groups having collective ends in view, and it translates
collective sentiments. So we may assume that the same is true
for the second.</p>

<p>In fact, an analysis of the principle of causality is sufficient
to assure us that the diverse elements of which it is composed
really did have this origin.</p>

<p>The first thing which is implied in the notion of the causal
relation is the idea of efficacy, of productive power, of active
force. By cause we ordinarily mean something capable of producing
a certain change. The cause is the force before it has
shown the power which is in it; the effect is this same power,
only actualized. Men have always thought of causality in
dynamic terms. Of course certain philosophers had refused all
objective value to this conception; they see in it only an arbitrary
construction of the imagination, which corresponds to
nothing in the things themselves. But, at present, we have no
need of asking whether it is founded in reality or not; it is
enough for us to state that it exists and that it constitutes and
always has constituted an element of ordinary mentality; and
this is recognized even by those who criticize it. Our immediate
purpose is to seek, not what it may be worth logically, but how
it is to be explained.</p>

<p>Now it depends upon social causes. Our analysis of facts has
already enabled us to see that the prototype of the idea of force
was the mana, wakan, orenda, the totemic principle or any of
the various names given to collective force objectified and
projected into things.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> The first power which men have thought
of as such seems to have been that exercised by humanity over
its members. Thus reason confirms the results of observation; in
fact, it is even possible to show why this notion of power, efficacy
or active force could not have come from any other source.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is evident and recognized by all that it
could not be furnished to us by external experience. Our senses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
only enable us to perceive phenomena which coexist or which
follow one another, but nothing perceived by them could give us
the idea of this determining and compelling action which is
characteristic of what we call a power or force. They can touch
only realized and known conditions, each separate from the
others; the internal process uniting these conditions escapes
them. Nothing that we learn could possibly suggest to us the
idea of what an influence or efficaciousness is. It is for this very
reason that the philosophers of empiricism have regarded these
different conceptions as so many mythological aberrations.
But even supposing that they all are hallucinations, it is still
necessary to show how they originated.</p>

<p>If external experience counts for nothing in the origin of
these ideas, and it is equally inadmissible that they were given
us ready-made, one might suppose that they come from internal
experience. In fact, the notion of force obviously includes many
spiritual elements which could only have been taken from our
psychic life.</p>

<p>Some have believed that the act by which our will brings a
deliberation to a close, restrains our impulses and commands our
organism, might have served as the model of this construction.
In willing, it is said, we perceive ourselves directly as a power in
action. So when this idea had once occurred to men, it seems
that they only had to extend it to things to establish the conception
of force.</p>

<p>As long as the animist theory passed as a demonstrated truth,
this explanation was able to appear to be confirmed by history.
If the forces with which human thought primitively populated
the world really had been spirits, that is to say, personal and
conscious beings more or less similar to men, it was actually
possible to believe that our individual experience was enough to
furnish us with the constituent elements of the notion of force.
But we know that the first forces which men imagined were, on
the contrary, anonymous, vague and diffused powers which
resemble cosmic forces in their impersonality, and which are
therefore most sharply contrasted with the eminently personal
power, the human will. So it is impossible that they should
have been conceived in its image.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is one essential characteristic of the impersonal
forces which would be inexplicable under this hypothesis: this
is their communicability. The forces of nature have always
been thought of as capable of passing from one object to another,
of mixing, combining and transforming themselves into one
another. It is even this property which gives them their value
as an explanation, for it is through this that effects can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
connected with their causes without a break of continuity. Now
the self has just the opposite characteristic: it is incommunicable.
It cannot change its material substratum or spread from one to
another; it spreads out in metaphor only. So the way in which
it decides and executes its decisions could never have suggested
the idea of an energy which communicates itself and which can
even confound itself with others and, through these combinations
and mixings, give rise to new effects.</p>

<p>Therefore, the idea of force, as implied in the conception of
the causal relation, must present a double character. In the
first place, it can come only from our internal experience; the
only forces which we can directly learn about are necessarily
moral forces. But, at the same time, they must be impersonal,
for the notion of an impersonal power was the first to be constituted.
Now the only ones which satisfy these two conditions
are those coming from life together: they are collective
forces. In fact, these are, on the one hand, entirely psychical;
they are made up exclusively of objectified ideas and sentiments.
But, on the other hand, they are impersonal by definition, for
they are the product of a co-operation. Being the work of all,
they are not the possession of anybody in particular. They are
so slightly attached to the personalities of the subjects in whom
they reside that they are never fixed there.  Just as they enter
them from without, they are also always ready to leave them.
Of themselves, they tend to spread further and further and to
invade ever new domains: we know that there are none more
contagious, and consequently more communicable. Of course
physical forces have the same property, but we cannot know
this directly; we cannot even become acquainted with them as
such, for they are outside us. When I throw myself against an
obstacle, I have a sensation of hindrance and trouble; but the
force causing this sensation is not in me, but in the obstacle,
and is consequently outside the circle of my perception. We
perceive its effects, but we cannot reach the cause itself. It is
otherwise with social forces: they are a part of our internal
life, as we know, more than the products of their action; we see
them acting. The force isolating the sacred being and holding
profane beings at a distance is not really in this being; it lives
in the minds of the believers. So they perceive it at the very
moment when it is acting upon their wills, to inhibit certain
movements or command others. In a word, this constraining
and necessitating action, which escapes us when coming from an
external object, is readily perceptible here because everything is
inside us. Of course we do not always interpret it in an adequate
manner, but at least we cannot fail to be conscious of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, the idea of force bears the mark of its origin in an
apparent way. In fact, it implies the idea of power which, in its
turn, does not come without those of ascendancy, mastership
and domination, and their corollaries, dependence and subordination;
now the relations expressed by all these ideas are
eminently social. It is society which classifies beings into
superiors and inferiors, into commanding masters and obeying
servants; it is society which confers upon the former the singular
property which makes the command efficacious and which makes
<i>power</i>. So everything tends to prove that the first powers of which
the human mind had any idea were those which societies have
established in organizing themselves: it is in their image that the
powers of the physical world have been conceived. Also, men have
never succeeded in imagining themselves as forces mistress over the
bodies in which they reside, except by introducing concepts taken
from social life. In fact, these must be distinguished from their
physical doubles and must be attributed a dignity superior to that
of these latter; in a word, they must think of themselves as souls.
As a matter of fact, men have always given the form of souls to
the forces which they believe that they are. But we know that
the soul is quite another thing from a name given to the abstract
faculty of moving, thinking and feeling; before all, it is a religious
principle, a particular aspect of the collective force. In fine, a
man feels that he has a soul, and consequently a force, because
he is a social being. Though an animal moves its members
just as we do, and though it has the same power as we over its
muscles, nothing authorizes us to suppose that it is conscious of
itself as an active and efficacious cause. This is because it does
not have, or, to speak more exactly, does not attribute to itself
a soul. But if it does not attribute a soul to itself, it is because
it does not participate in a social life comparable to that of
men. Among animals, there is nothing resembling a civilization.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<p>But the notion of force is not all of the principle of causality.
This consists in a judgment stating that every force develops in
a definite manner, and that the state in which it is at each
particular moment of its existence predetermines the next state.
The former is called cause, the latter, effect, and the causal
judgment affirms the existence of a necessary connection between
these two moments for every force. The mind posits this
connection before having any proofs of it, under the empire of
a sort of constraint from which it cannot free itself; it postulates
it, as they say, <i>a priori</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>Empiricism has never succeeded in accounting for this
apriorism and necessity. Philosophers of this school have never
been able to explain how an association of ideas, reinforced by
habit, could produce more than an expectation or a stronger or
weaker predisposition on the part of ideas to appear in a determined
order. But the principle of causality has quite another
character. It is not merely an imminent tendency of our thought
to take certain forms; it is an external norm, superior to the
flow of our representations, which it dominates and rules imperatively.
It is invested with an authority which binds the
mind and surpasses it, which is as much as to say that the mind
is not its artisan. In this connection, it is useless to substitute
hereditary habit for individual habit, for habit does not change
its nature by lasting longer than one man's life; it is merely
stronger. An instinct is not a rule.</p>

<p>The rites which we have been studying allow us to catch
a glimpse of another source of this authority, which, up to the
present, has scarcely been suspected. Let us bear in mind how
the law of causality, which the imitative rites put into practice,
was born. Being filled with one single preoccupation, the group
assembles: if the species whose name it bears does not reproduce,
it is a matter of concern to the whole clan. The common
sentiment thus animating all the members is outwardly expressed
by certain gestures, which are always the same in the same
circumstances, and after the ceremony has been performed, it
happens, for the reasons set forth, that the desired result seems
obtained. So an association arises between the idea of this
result and that of the gestures preceding it; and this association
does not vary from one subject to another; it is the same for
all the participators in the rite, since it is the product of a collective
experience. However, if no other factor intervened, it
would produce only a collective expectation; after the imitative
gestures had been accomplished, everybody would await the
subsequent appearance of the desired event, with more or less
confidence; an imperative rule of thought could never be
established by this. But since a social interest of the greatest
importance is at stake, society cannot allow things to follow
their own course at the whim of circumstances; it intervenes
actively in such a way as to regulate their march in conformity
with its needs. So it demands that this ceremony, which it
cannot do without, be repeated every time that it is necessary,
and consequently, that the movements, a condition of its success,
be executed regularly: it imposes them as an obligation. Now
they imply a certain definite state of mind which, in return,
participates in this same obligatory character. To prescribe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
that one must imitate an animal or plant to make them reproduce,
is equivalent to stating it as an axiom which is above all doubt,
that like produces like. Opinion cannot allow men to deny this
principle in theory without also allowing them to violate it in
their conduct. So society imposes it, along with the practices
which are derived from it, and thus the ritual precept is doubled
by a logical precept which is only the intellectual aspect of the
former. The authority of each is derived from the same source:
society. The respect which this inspires is communicated to
the ways of thought to which it attaches a value, just as much
as to ways of action. So a man cannot set aside either the ones
or the others without hurling himself against public opinion.
This is why the former require the adherence of the intelligence
before examination, just as the latter require the submission of
the will.</p>

<p>From this example, we can show once more how the sociological
theory of the idea of causality, and of the categories in general,
sets aside the classical doctrines on the question, while conciliating
them. Together with apriorism, it maintains the prejudicial
and necessary character of the causal relation; but it
does not limit itself to affirming this; it accounts for it, yet
without making it vanish under the pretext of explaining it,
as empiricism does. On the other hand, there is no question
of denying the part due to individual experience. There can be
no doubt that by himself, the individual observes the regular
succession of phenomena and thus acquires a certain <i>feeling</i> of
regularity. But this feeling is not the <i>category</i> of causality.
The former is individual, subjective, incommunicable; we make
it ourselves, out of our own personal observations. The second
is the work of the group, and is given to us ready-made. It is
a frame-work in which our empirical ascertainments arrange
themselves and which enables us to think of them, that is to say,
to see them from a point of view which makes it possible for us
to understand one another in regard to them. Of course, if this
frame can be applied to the contents, that shows that it is not
out of relation with the matter which it contains; but it is not
to be confused with this. It surpasses it and dominates it. This
is because it is of a different origin. It is not a mere summary
of individual experiences; before all else, it is made to fulfil
the exigencies of life in common.</p>

<p>In fine, the error of empiricism has been to regard the causal
bond as merely an intellectual construction of speculative thought
and the product of a more or less methodical generalization.
Now, by itself, pure speculation can give birth only to provisional,
hypothetical and more or less plausible views, but ones which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
must always be regarded with suspicion, for we can never be
sure that some new observation in the future will not invalidate
them. An axiom which the mind accepts and must accept,
without control and without reservation, could never come
from this source. Only the necessities of action, and especially
of collective action, can and must express themselves in categorical
formul&aelig;, which are peremptory and short, and admit
of no contradiction, for collective movements are possible only
on condition of being in concert and, therefore, regulated and
definite. They do not allow of any fumbling, the source of
anarchy; by themselves, they tend towards an organization
which, when once established, imposes itself upon individuals.
And as action cannot go beyond intelligence, it frequently
happens that the latter is drawn into the same way and accepts
without discussion the theoretical postulates demanded by
action. The imperatives of thought are probably only another
side of the imperatives of action.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that we have never dreamed
of offering the preceding observations as a complete theory
of the concept of causality. The question is too complex to be
resolved thus. The principle of causality has been understood
differently in different times and places; in a single society,
it varies with the social environment and the kingdoms of nature
to which it is applied.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> So it would be impossible to determine
with sufficient precision the causes and conditions upon which it
depends, after a consideration of only one of the forms which it has
presented during the course of history. The views which we
have set forth should be regarded as mere indications, which
must be controlled and completed. However, as the causal law
which we have been considering is certainly one of the most
primitive which exists, and as it has played a considerable part
in the development of human thought and industry, it is a privileged
experiment, so we may presume that the remarks of which
it has been the occasion may be generalized to a certain degree.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER IV</b><br /><br />

<small>THE POSITIVE CULT&mdash;<i>continued</i></small><br /><br />

III.&mdash;<i>Representative or Commemorative Rites</i></h3>


<p>The explanation which we have given of the positive rites
of which we have been speaking in the two preceding
chapters attributes to them a significance which is, above all,
moral and social. The physical efficaciousness assigned to them
by the believer is the product of an interpretation which conceals
the essential reason for their existence: it is because they serve
to remake individuals and groups morally that they are believed
to have a power over things. But even if this hypothesis has
enabled us to account for the facts, we cannot say that it has
been demonstrated directly; at first view, it even seems to
conciliate itself rather badly with the nature of the ritual
mechanisms which we have analysed. Whether they consist
in oblations or imitative acts, the gestures composing them
have purely material ends in view; they have, or seem to have,
the sole object of making the totemic species reproduce. Under
these circumstances, is it not surprising that their real function
should be to serve moral ends?</p>

<p>It is true that their physical function may have been
exaggerated by Spencer and Gillen, even in the cases where
it is the most incontestable. According to these authors, each
clan celebrates its Intichiuma for the purpose of assuring a
useful food to the other clans, and the whole cult consists in
a sort of economic co-operation of the different totemic groups;
each works for the others. But according to Strehlow, this
conception of Australian totemism is wholly foreign to the
native mind. "If," he says, "the members of one totemic
group set themselves to multiplying the animals or plants of the
consecrated species, and seem to work for their companions
of other totems, we must be careful not to regard this collaboration
as the fundamental principle of Arunta or Loritja totemism.
The blacks themselves have never told me that this was the
object of their ceremonies. Of course, when I suggested and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
explained the idea to them, they understood it and acquiesced.
But I should not be blamed for having some distrust of replies
gained in this fashion." Strehlow also remarks that this way
of interpreting the rite is contradicted by the fact that the totemic
animals and plants are not all edible or useful; some are good
for nothing; some are even dangerous. So the ceremonies which
concern them could not have any such end in view.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> "When
some one asks the natives what the determining reason for these
ceremonies is," concludes our author, "they are unanimous
in replying: 'It is because our ancestors arranged things thus.
This is why we do thus and not differently.'"<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> But in saying
that the rite is observed because it comes from the ancestors, it
is admitted that its authority is confounded with the authority
of tradition, which is a social affair of the first order. Men
celebrate it to remain faithful to the past, to keep for the group
its normal physiognomy, and not because of the physical effects
which it may produce. Thus, the way in which the believers
themselves explain them show the profound reasons upon which
the rites proceed.</p>

<p>But there are cases when this aspect of the ceremonies is
immediately apparent.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>These may be observed the best among the Warramunga.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a></p>

<p>Among this people, each clan is thought to be descended
from a single ancestor who, after having been born in some
determined spot, passed his terrestrial existence in travelling
over the country in every direction. It is he who, in the course
of his voyages, gave to the land the form which it now has;
it is he who made the mountains and plains, the water-holes
and streams, etc. At the same time, he sowed upon his route
living germs which were disengaged from his body and, after
many successive reincarnations, became the actual members
of the clan. Now the ceremony of the Warramunga which
corresponds exactly to the Intichiuma of the Arunta, has the
object of commemorating and representing the mythical history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of this ancestor. There is no question of oblations or, except
in one single case,<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> of imitative practices. The rite consists
solely in recollecting the past and, in a way, making it present
by means of a veritable dramatic representation. This word is
the more exact because in this ceremony, the officiant is in no
way considered an incarnation of the ancestor, whom he represents;
he is an actor playing a r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>As an example, let us describe the Intichiuma of the Black
Snake, as Spencer and Gillen observed it.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p>An initial ceremony does not seem to refer to the past; at
least the description of it which is given us gives no authorization
for interpreting it in this sense. It consists in running and leaping
on the part of two officiants,<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> who are decorated with designs
representing the black snake. When they finally fall exhausted
on the ground, the assistants gently pass their hands over the
emblematic designs with which the backs of the two actors
are covered. They say that this act pleases the black snake. It
is only afterwards that the series of commemorative ceremonies
commences.</p>

<p>They put into action the mythical history of the ancestor
Thalaualla, from the moment he emerged from the ground up
to his definite return thither. They follow him through all his
voyages. The myth says that in each of the localities where he
sojourned, he celebrated totemic ceremonies; they now repeat
them in the same order in which they are supposed to have
taken place originally. The movement which is acted the most
frequently consists in twisting the entire body about rhythmically
and violently; this is because the ancestor did the
same thing to make the germs of life which were in him come
out. The actors have their bodies covered with down, which is
detached and flies away during these movements; this is a way
of representing the flight of these mystic germs and their dispersion
into space.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that among the Arunta, the scene
of the ceremony is determined by the ritual: it is the spot
where the sacred rocks, trees and water-holes are found, and
the worshippers must go there to celebrate the cult. Among
the Warramunga, on the contrary, the ceremonial ground is
arbitrarily chosen according to convenience. It is a conventional
scene. However, the original scene of the events whose reproduction
constitutes the theme of the rite is itself represented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
means of designs. Sometimes these designs are made upon
the very bodies of the actors. For example, a small circle coloured
red, painted on the back and stomach, represents a water-hole.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
In other cases, the image is traced on the soil. Upon a ground
previously soaked and covered with red ochre, they draw curved
lines, made up of a series of white points, which symbolize a
stream or a mountain. This is a beginning of decoration.</p>

<p>In addition to the properly religious ceremonies which the
ancestor is believed to have celebrated long ago, they also
represent simple episodes of his career, either epic or comic.
Thus, at a given moment, while three actors are on the scene,
occupied in an important rite, another one hides behind a bunch
of trees situated at some distance. A packet of down is attached
about his neck which represents a <i>wallaby</i>. As soon as the
principal ceremony is finished, an old man traces a line upon
the ground which is directed towards the spot where the fourth
actor is hidden. The others march behind him, with eyes lowered
and fixed upon this line, as though following a trail. When
they discover the man, they assume a stupefied air and one of
them beats him with a club. This represents an incident in the
life of the great black snake. One day, his son went hunting,
caught a <i>wallaby</i> and ate it without giving his father any. The
latter followed his tracks, surprised him and forced him to
disgorge; it is to this that the beating at the end of the representation
alludes.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>We shall not relate here all the mythical events which are
represented successively. The preceding examples are sufficient
to show the character of these ceremonies: they are dramas,
but of a particular variety; they act, or at least they are believed
to act, upon the course of nature. When the commemoration
of Thalaualla is terminated, the Warramunga are convinced
that black snakes cannot fail to increase and multiply. So
these dramas are rites, and even rites which, by the nature of
their efficacy, are comparable on every point to those which
constitute the Intichiuma of the Arunta.</p>

<p>Therefore each is able to clarify the other. It is even more
legitimate to compare them than if there were no break of
continuity between them. Not only is the end pursued identical
in each case, but the most characteristic part of the Warramunga
ritual is found in germ in the other. In fact, the Intichiuma,
as the Arunta generally perform it, contains within it a sort of
implicit commemoration. The places where it is celebrated are
necessarily those which the ancestor made illustrious. The roads
over which the worshippers pass in the course of their pious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
pilgrimages are those which the heroes of the Alcheringa traversed;
the places where they stop to proceed with the rites are those
where their fathers sojourned themselves, where they vanished
into the ground, etc. So everything brings their memory to the
minds of the assistants. Moreover, to the manual rites they
frequently add hymns relating the exploits of their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>
If, instead of being told, these stories are acted, and if, in this
new form, they develop in such a way as to become an essential
part of the ceremony, then we have the ceremony of the Warramunga.
But even more can be said, for on one side, the Arunta
Intichiuma is already a sort of representation. The officiant is
one with the ancestor from whom he is descended and whom he
reincarnates.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> The gestures he makes are those which this
ancestor made in the same circumstances. Speaking exactly, of
course he does not play the part of the ancestral personage
as an actor might do it; he is this personage himself. But it
is true, notwithstanding, that, in one sense, it is the hero who
occupies the scene. In order to accentuate the representative
character of the rite, it would be sufficient for the duality of the
ancestor and the officiant to become more marked; this is just
what happens among the Warramunga.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> Even among the
Arunta, at least one Intichiuma is mentioned in which certain
persons are charged with representing ancestors with whom
they have no relationship of mythical descent, and in which
there is consequently a proper dramatic representation: this is
the Intichiuma of the Emu.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> It seems that in this case, also,
contrarily to the general rule among this people, the theatre
of the ceremony is artificially arranged.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not follow from the fact that, in spite of the differences
separating them, these two varieties of ceremony thus have
an air of kinship, as it were, that there is a definite relation of
succession between them, and that one is a transformation of
the other. It may very well be that the resemblances pointed
out come from the fact that the two sprang from the same source,
that is, from the same original ceremony, of which they are
only divergent forms: we shall even see that this hypothesis
is the most probable one. But even without taking sides on this
question, what has already been said is enough to show that
they are rites of the same nature. So we may be allowed to
compare them, and to use the one to enable us to understand the
other better.</p>

<p>Now the peculiar thing in the ceremonies of the Warramunga
of which we have been speaking, is that not a gesture is made
whose object is to aid or to provoke directly the increase of the
totemic species.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> If we analyse the movements made, as well
as the words spoken, we generally find nothing which betrays
any intention of this sort. Everything is in representations whose
only object can be to render the mythical past of the clan present
to the mind. But the mythology of a group is the system of
beliefs common to this group. The traditions whose memory it
perpetuates express the way in which society represents man
and the world; it is a moral system and a cosmology as well as
a history. So the rite serves and can serve only to sustain the
vitality of these beliefs, to keep them from being effaced from
memory and, in sum, to revivify the most essential elements
of the collective consciousness. Through it, the group periodically
renews the sentiment which it has of itself and of its unity;
at the same time, individuals are strengthened in their social
natures. The glorious souvenirs which are made to live again
before their eyes, and with which they feel that they have a
kinship, give them a feeling of strength and confidence: a man
is surer of his faith when he sees to how distant a past it goes
back and what great things it has inspired. This is the characteristic
of the ceremony which makes it instructive. Its tendency
is to act entirely upon the mind and upon it alone. So if men
believe nevertheless that it acts upon things and that it assures
the prosperity of the species, this can be only as a reaction to
the moral action which it exercises and which is obviously the
only one which is real. Thus the hypothesis which we have
proposed is verified by a significant experiment, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
verification is the more convincing because, as we have shown,
there is no difference in nature between the ritual system of
the Warramunga and that of the Arunta. The one only makes
more evident what we had already conjectured from the other.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>But there are ceremonies in which this representative and
idealistic character is still more accentuated.</p>

<p>In those of which we have been speaking, the dramatic representation
did not exist for itself; it was only a means having
a very material end in view, namely, the reproduction of the
totemic species. But there are others which do not differ
materially from the preceding ones, but from which, nevertheless,
all preoccupations of this sort are absent. The past is here
represented for the mere sake of representing it and fixing it
more firmly in the mind, while no determined action over nature
is expected of the rite. At least, the physical effects sometimes
imputed to it are wholly secondary and have no relation with
the liturgical importance attributed to it.</p>

<p>This is the case notably with the ceremonies which the Warramunga
celebrate in honour of the snake Wollunqua.<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a></p>

<p>As we have already said, the Wollunqua is a totem of a very
especial sort. It is not an animal or vegetable species, but a
unique being: there is only one Wollunqua. Moreover, this
being is purely mythical. The natives represent it as a colossal
snake whose length is such that when it rises on its tail its head
is lost in the clouds. It resides, they believe, in a water-hole
called Thapauerlu, which is hidden in the bottom of a solitary
valley. But if it differs in certain ways from the ordinary totems,
it has all their distinctive characteristics nevertheless. It serves
as the collective name and emblem of a whole group of individuals
who regard it as their common ancestor, while the relations
which they sustain with this mythical beast are identical with
those which the members of other totems believe that they
sustain with the founders of their respective clans. In the
Alcheringa<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> times, the Wollunqua traversed the country in
every direction. In the different localities where it stopped,
it scattered "spirit-children," the spiritual principles which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
still serve as the souls of the living of to-day. The Wollunqua
is even considered as a sort of pre-eminent totem. The Warramunga
are divided into two phratries, called Uluuru and Kingilli.
Nearly all the totems of the former are snakes of different kinds.
Now they are all believed to be descended from the Wollunqua;
they say that it was their grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> From this, we can
catch a glimpse of how the myth of the Wollunqua probably
arose. In order to explain the presence of so many similar
totems in the same phratry, they imagined that all were derived
from one and the same totem; it was necessary to give it a
gigantic form so that in its very appearance it might conform
to the considerable r&ocirc;le assigned to it in the history of the tribe.</p>

<p>Now the Wollunqua is the object of ceremonies not differing
in nature from those which we have already studied: they are
representations in which are portrayed the principal events
of its fabulous life. They show it coming out of the ground and
passing from one locality to another; they represent different
episodes in its voyages, etc. Spencer and Gillen assisted at
fifteen ceremonies of this sort which took place between the
27th of July and the 23rd of August, all being linked together
in a determined order, in such a way as to form a veritable
cycle.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> In the details of the rites constituting it, this long celebration
is therefore indistinct from the ordinary Intichiuma
of the Warramunga, as is recognized by the authors who have
described it to us.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> But, on the other hand, it is an Intichiuma
which could not have the object of assuring the fecundity of
an animal or vegetable species, for the Wollunqua is a species
all by itself and does not reproduce. It exists, and the natives
do not seem to feel that it has need of a cult to preserve it in
its existence. These ceremonies not only seem to lack the efficacy
of the classic Intichiuma, but it even seems as though they
have no material efficacy of any sort. The Wollunqua is not a
divinity set over a special order of natural phenomena, so they
expect no definite service from him in exchange for the cult.
Of course they say that if the ritual prescriptions are badly
observed, the Wollunqua becomes angry, leaves his retreat and
comes to punish his worshippers for their negligence; and
inversely, when everything passes regularly, they are led to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
believe that they will be fortunate and that some happy event
will take place; but it is quite evident that these possible
sanctions are an after-thought to explain the rite. After the
ceremony had been established, it seemed natural that it should
serve for something, and that the omission of the prescribed
observances should therefore expose one to grave dangers.
But it was not established to forestall these mythical dangers
or to assure particular advantages. The natives, moreover,
have only the very haziest ideas of them. When the whole
ceremony is completed, the old men announce that if the Wollunqua
is pleased, he will send rain. But it is not to have rain that
they go through with the celebration.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> They celebrate it because
their ancestors did, because they are attached to it as to a highly
respected tradition and because they leave it with a feeling of
moral well-being. Other considerations have only a complimentary
part; they may serve to strengthen the worshippers
in the attitude prescribed by the rite, but they are not the reason
for the existence of this attitude.</p>

<p>So we have here a whole group of ceremonies whose sole purpose
is to awaken certain ideas and sentiments, to attach the present
to the past or the individual to the group. Not only are they
unable to serve useful ends, but the worshippers themselves
demand none. This is still another proof that the psychical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
state in which the assembled group happens to be constitutes
the only solid and stable basis of what we may call the ritual
mentality. The beliefs which attribute such or such a physical
efficaciousness to the rites are wholly accessory and contingent,
for they may be lacking without causing any alteration in the
essentials of the rite. Thus the ceremonies of the Wollunqua
show even better than the preceding ones the fundamental
function of the positive cult.</p>

<p>If we have insisted especially upon these solemnities, it is
because of their exceptional importance. But there are others
with exactly the same character. Thus, the Warramunga
have a totem "of the laughing boy." Spencer and Gillen say
that the clan bearing this name has the same organization as
the other totemic groups. Like them, it has its sacred places
(<i>mungai</i>) where the founder-ancestor celebrated ceremonies in
the fabulous times, and where he left behind him spirit-children
who became the men of the clan; the rites connected with this
totem are indistinguishable from those relating to the animal
or vegetable totems.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> Yet it is evident that they could not have
any physical efficaciousness. They consist in a series of four
ceremonies which repeat one another more or less, but which
are intended only to amuse and to provoke laughter by laughter,
in fine, to maintain the gaiety and good-humour which the group
has as its speciality.<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>We find more than one totem among the Arunta themselves
which has no other Intichiuma. We have seen that among this
people, the irregularities and depressions of the land, which
mark the places where some ancestor sojourned, sometimes
serve as totems.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> Ceremonies are attached to these totems
which are manifestly incapable of physical effects of any sort.
They can consist only in representations whose object is to
commemorate the past, and they can aim at no end beyond
this commemoration.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a></p>

<p>While they enable us to understand the nature of the cult better,
these ritual representations also put into evidence an important
element of religion: this is the recreative and esthetic element.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to show that they are closely
akin to dramatic representations.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> This kinship appears with
still greater clarity in the latter ceremonies of which we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
spoken. Not only do they employ the same processes as the
real drama, but they also pursue an end of the same sort: being
foreign to all utilitarian ends, they make men forget the real
world and transport them into another where their imagination
is more at ease; they distract. They sometimes even go so far
as to have the outward appearance of a recreation: the assistants
may be seen laughing and amusing themselves openly.<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>Representative rites and collective recreations are even so
close to one another that men pass from one sort to the other
without any break of continuity. The characteristic feature
of the properly religious ceremonies is that they must be celebrated
on a consecrated ground, from which women and non-initiated
persons are excluded.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> But there are others in which
this religious character is somewhat effaced, though it has not
disappeared completely. They take place outside the ceremonial
ground, which proves that they are already laicized to a certain
degree; but profane persons, women and children, are not
yet admitted to them. So they are on the boundary between
the two domains. They generally deal with legendary personages,
but ones having no regular place in the frame-work of the totemic
religion. They are spirits, more generally malevolent ones,
having relations with the magicians rather than the ordinary
believers, and sorts of bugbears, in whom men do not believe
with the same degree of seriousness and firmness of conviction
as in the proper totemic beings and things.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> As the bonds by
which the events and personages represented are attached to
the history of the tribe relax, these take on a proportionately
more unreal appearance, while the corresponding ceremonies
change in nature. Thus men enter into the domain of pure
fancy, and pass from the commemorative rite to the ordinary
corrobbori, a simple public merry-making, which has nothing
religious about it and in which all may take part indifferently.
Perhaps some of these representations, whose sole object now
is to distract, are ancient rites, whose character has been changed.
In fact, the distinction between these two sorts of ceremonies
is so variable that it is impossible to state with precision to
which of the two kinds they belong.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that games and the principal forms
of art seem to have been born of religion and that for a long
time they retained a religious character.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> We now see what the
reasons for this are: it is because the cult, though aimed primarily
at other ends, has also been a sort of recreation for men. Religion
has not played this r&ocirc;le by hazard or owing to a happy chance,
but through a necessity of its nature. Though, as we have
established, religious thought is something very different from
a system of fictions, still the realities to which it corresponds
express themselves religiously only when religion transfigures
them. Between society as it is objectively and the sacred
things which express it symbolically, the distance is considerable.
It has been necessary that the impressions really felt by men,
which served as the original matter of this construction, should
be interpreted, elaborated and transformed until they became
unrecognizable. So the world of religious things is a partially
imaginary world, though only in its outward form, and one
which therefore lends itself more readily to the free creations
of the mind. Also, since the intellectual forces which serve to
make it are intense and tumultuous, the unique task of expressing
the real with the aid of appropriate symbols is not enough to
occupy them. A surplus generally remains available which seeks
to employ itself in supplementary and superfluous works of
luxury, that is to say, in works of art. There are practices
as well as beliefs of this sort. The state of effervescence in which
the assembled worshippers find themselves must be translated
outwardly by exuberant movements which are not easily subjected
to too carefully defined ends. In part, they escape aimlessly,
they spread themselves for the mere pleasure of so doing,
and they take delight in all sorts of games. Besides, in so far
as the beings to whom the cult is addressed are imaginary,
they are not able to contain and regulate this exuberance; the
pressure of tangible and resisting realities is required to confine
activities to exact and economical forms. Therefore one exposes
oneself to grave misunderstandings if, in explaining rites, he
believes that each gesture has a precise object and a definite
reason for its existence. There are some which serve nothing;
they merely answer the need felt by worshippers for action,
motion, gesticulation. They are to be seen jumping, whirling,
dancing, crying and singing, though it may not always be possible
to give a meaning to all this agitation.</p>

<p>Therefore religion would not be itself if it did not give some
place to the free combinations of thought and activity, to play,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
to art, to all that recreates the spirit that has been fatigued
by the too great slavishness of daily work: the very same causes
which called it into existence make it a necessity. Art is not
merely an external ornament with which the cult has adorned
itself in order to dissimulate certain of its features which may
be too austere and too rude; but rather, in itself, the cult is
something &aelig;sthetic. Owing to the well-known connection
which mythology has with poetry, some have wished to exclude
the former from religion;<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> the truth is that there is a poetry
inherent in all religion. The representative rites which have
just been studied make this aspect of the religious life manifest;
but there are scarcely any rites which do not present it to some
degree.</p>

<p>One would certainly commit the gravest error if he saw only
this one aspect of religion, or if he even exaggerated its importance.
When a rite serves only to distract, it is no longer a
rite. The moral forces expressed by religious symbols are real
forces with which we must reckon and with which we cannot
do what we will. Even when the cult aims at producing no
physical effects, but limits itself to acting on the mind, its action
is in quite a different way from that of a pure work of art. The
representations which it seeks to awaken and maintain in our
minds are not vain images which correspond to nothing in
reality, and which we call up aimlessly for the mere satisfaction
of seeing them appear and combine before our eyes. They are
as necessary for the well working of our moral life as our food is
for the maintenance of our physical life, for it is through them
that the group affirms and maintains itself, and we know the
point to which this is indispensable for the individual. So a
rite is something different from a game; it is a part of the
serious life. But if its unreal and imaginary element is not
essential, nevertheless it plays a part which is by no means
negligible. It has its share in the feeling of comfort which the
worshipper draws from the rite performed; for recreation is one
of the forms of the moral remaking which is the principal object
of the positive rite. After we have acquitted ourselves of our
ritual duties, we enter into the profane life with increased courage
and ardour, not only because we come into relations with a
superior source of energy, but also because our forces have been
reinvigorated by living, for a few moments, in a life that is less
strained, and freer and easier. Hence religion acquires a charm
which is not among the slightest of its attractions.</p>

<p>This is why the very idea of a religious ceremony of some
importance awakens the idea of a feast. Inversely, every feast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
even when it has purely lay origins, has certain characteristics
of the religious ceremony, for in every case its effect is to bring
men together, to put the masses into movement and thus to
excite a state of effervescence, and sometimes even of delirium,
which is not without a certain kinship with the religious state.
A man is carried outside himself and diverted from his ordinary
occupation and preoccupations. Thus the same manifestations
are to be observed in each case: cries, songs, music, violent
movements, dances, the search for exciteants which raise the
vital level, etc. It has frequently been remarked that popular
feasts lead to excesses, and cause men to lose sight of the distinction
separating the licit from the illicit;<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> there are also
religious ceremonies which make it almost necessary to violate
the rules which are ordinarily the most respected.<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> Of course this
does not mean that there is no way to distinguish these two forms
of public activity. The simple merry-making, the profane
corrobbori, has no serious object, while, as a whole, a ritual
ceremony always has an important end. Still it is to be remembered
that there is perhaps no merry-making in which the
serious life does not have some echo. The difference consists
rather in the unequal proportions in which the two elements are
combined.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>A more general fact confirms the views which precede.</p>

<p>In their first book, Spencer and Gillen presented the Intichiuma
as a perfectly definite ritual entity: they spoke of it
as though it were an operation destined exclusively for the
assurance of the reproduction of the totemic species, and it seemed
as though it ought to lose all meaning, if this unique function
were set aside. But in their <i>Northern Tribes of Central Australia</i>,
the same authors use a different language, though perhaps
without noticing it. They recognize that these same ceremonies
may take place either in the regular Intichiuma or in the initiation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
rites.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> So they serve equally in the making of animals or plants
of the totemic species, or in conferring upon novices the qualities
necessary to make them regular members of the men's society.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a>
From this point of view, the Intichiuma takes on a new aspect.
It is no longer a distinct ritual mechanism, resting upon
principles of its own, but a particular application of more general
ceremonies which may be utilized for very different ends. For
this reason, in their later work, before speaking of the Intichiuma
and the initiation they consecrate a special chapter to the totemic
ceremonies in general, making abstraction of the diverse forms
which they may take, according to the ends for which they are
employed.<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p>This fundamental indetermination of the totemic ceremonies
was only indicated by Spencer and Gillen, and rather indirectly
at that; but it has now been confirmed by Strehlow in more
explicit terms. "When they lead the young novices through
the different feasts of the initiation," he says, "they perform
before them a series of ceremonies which, though reproducing,
even in their most characteristic details, the rites of the regular
cult (viz. <i>the rites which Spencer and Gillen call the Intichiuma</i>),
do not have, nevertheless, the end of multiplying the corresponding
totem and causing it to prosper."<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> It is the same ceremony
which serves in the two cases; the name alone is not the same.
When its special object is the reproduction of the species, they
call it <i>mbatjalkatiuma</i> and it is only when it is a part of the process
of initiation that they give it the name Intichiuma.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, these two sorts of ceremonies are distinguished
from one another among the Arunta by certain secondary
characteristics. Though the structure of the rite is the same in
both cases, still we know that the effusions of blood and, more
generally, the oblations characteristic of the Arunta Intichiuma
are not found in the initiation ceremonies. Moreover, among
this same people, the Intichiuma takes place at a spot regularly
fixed by tradition, to which men must make a pilgrimage, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the scene of the initiation ceremonies is purely conventional.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
But when the Intichiuma consists in a simple dramatic representation,
as is the case among the Warramunga, the lack of
distinction between the two rites is complete. In the one as
in the other, they commemorate the past, they put the myth
into action, they play&mdash;and one cannot play in two materially
different ways. So, according to the circumstances, one and the
same ceremony serves two distinct functions.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a></p>

<p>It may even lend itself to other uses. We know that as blood
is a sacred thing, women must not see it flow. Yet it happens
sometimes that a quarrel breaks out in their presence and ends
in the shedding of blood. Thus an infraction of the ritual is
committed. Among the Arunta, the man whose blood flowed
first must, to atone for this fault, "celebrate a ceremony connected
with the totem either of his father or of his mother";<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>
this ceremony has a special name, <i>Alua uparilima</i>, which means
the washing away of blood. But in itself, it does not differ from
those celebrated at the time of the initiation or in the Intichiuma:
it represents an event of ancestral history. So it may serve
equally to initiate, to act upon the totemic species or to expiate
a sacrilege. We shall see that a totemic ceremony may also
take the place of a funeral rite.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a></p>

<p>MM. Hubert and Mauss have already pointed out a functional
ambiguity of this same sort in the case of sacrifice, and more
especially, in that of Hindu sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> They have shown how
the sacrifice of communion, that of expiation, that of a vow
and that of a contract are only variations of one and the same
mechanism. We now see that the fact is much more primitive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
and in no way limited to the institution of sacrifice. Perhaps
no rite exists which does not present a similar indetermination.
The mass serves for marriages as for burials; it redeems the
faults of the dead and wins the favours of the deity for the living,
etc. Fasting is an expiation and a penance; but it is also a
preparation for communion; it even confers positive virtues.
This ambiguity shows that the real function of a rite does not
consist in the particular and definite effects which it seems
to aim at and by which it is ordinarily characterized, but rather
in a general action which, though always and everywhere the
same, is nevertheless capable of taking on different forms according
to the circumstances. Now this is just what is demanded
by the theory which we have proposed. If the real function
of the cult is to awaken within the worshippers a certain state
of soul, composed of moral force and confidence, and if the various
effects imputed to the rites are due only to a secondary and
variable determination of this fundamental state, it is not surprising
if a single rite, while keeping the same composition and
structure, seems to produce various effects. For the mental
dispositions, the excitation of which is its permanent function,
remain the same in every case; they depend upon the fact
that the group is assembled, and not upon the special reasons
for which it is assembled. But, on the other hand, they are
interpreted differently according to the circumstances to which
they are applied. Is it a physical result which they wish to
obtain? The confidence they feel convinces them that the
desired result is or will be obtained by the means employed.
Has some one committed a fault for which he wishes to atone?
The same state of moral assurance will lead him to attribute
expiatory virtues to these same ritual gestures. Thus, the
apparent efficacy will seem to change while the real efficacy
remains invariable, and the rite will seem to fulfil various
functions though in fact it has only one, which is always the
same.</p>

<p>Inversely, just as a single rite may serve many ends, so many
rites may produce the same effect and mutually replace one
another. To assure the reproduction of the totemic species,
one may have recourse equally to oblations, to imitative practices
or to commemorative representations. This aptitude of rites
for substituting themselves for one another proves once more
both their plasticity and the extreme generality of the useful
action which they exercise. The essential thing is that men are
assembled, that sentiments are felt in common and expressed in
common acts; but the particular nature of these sentiments
and acts is something relatively secondary and contingent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
To become conscious of itself, the group does not need to perform
certain acts in preference to all others. The necessary thing is
that it partakes of the same thought and the same action; the
visible forms in which this communion takes place matter but
little. Of course, these external forms do not come by chance;
they have their reasons; but these reasons do not touch the
essential part of the cult.</p>

<p>So everything leads us back to this same idea: before all,
rites are means by which the social group reaffirms itself
periodically. From this, we may be able to reconstruct hypothetically
the way in which the totemic cult should have arisen
originally. Men who feel themselves united, partially by bonds
of blood, but still more by a community of interest and tradition,
assemble and become conscious of their moral unity. For the
reasons which we have set forth, they are led to represent this
unity in the form of a very special kind of consubstantiality:
they think of themselves as all participating in the nature of
some determined animal. Under these circumstances, there is
only one way for them to affirm their collective existence: this
is to affirm that they are like the animals of this species, and to
do so not only in the silence of their own thoughts, but also by
material acts. These are the acts which make up the cult, and
they obviously can consist only in movements by which the man
imitates the animal with which he identifies himself. When
understood thus, the imitative rites appear as the first form of
the cult. It will be thought that this is attributing a very considerable
historical importance to practices which, at first view,
give the effect of childish games. But, as we have shown, these
na&iuml;ve and awkward gestures and these crude processes of representation
translate and maintain a sentiment of pride, confidence
and veneration wholly comparable to that expressed by the
worshippers in the most idealistic religions when, being assembled,
they proclaim themselves the children of the almighty God.
For in the one case as in the other, this sentiment is made up of
the same impressions of security and respect which are awakened
in individual consciousnesses by this great moral force which
dominates them and sustains them, and which is the collective
force.</p>

<p>The other rites which we have been studying are probably
only variations of this essential rite. When the close union
of the animal and men has once been admitted, men feel acutely
the necessity of assuring the regular reproduction of the principal
object of the cult. These imitative practices, which probably had
only a moral end at first, thus became subordinated to utilitarian
and material ends, and they were thought of as means of producing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
the desired result. But proportionately as, through the development
of mythology, the ancestral hero, who was at first confused
with the totemic animal, distinguished himself more and more,
and became a more personal figure, the imitation of the ancestor
was substituted for the imitation of the animal, or took a place
beside it, and then representative ceremonies replaced or completed
the imitative rites. Finally, to be surer of attaining the
end they sought, men felt the need of putting into action all
the means at their disposal. Close at hand they had reserves of
living forces accumulated in the sacred rocks, so they utilized
them; since the blood of the men was of the same nature as
that of the animal, they used it for the same purpose and shed
it. Inversely, owing to this same kinship, men used the flesh of
the animal to remake their own substance. Hence came the rites
of oblation and communion. But, at bottom, all these different
practices are only variations of one and the same theme: everywhere
their basis is the same state of mind, interpreted differently
according to the situations, the moments of history and the
dispositions of the worshippers.</p>

<h3><b>CHAPTER V</b><br /><br />

<small>PIACULAR RITES AND THE AMBIGUITY OF THE NOTION
OF SACREDNESS</small></h3>


<p>Howsoever much they may differ from one another in
the nature of the gestures they imply, the positive rites
which we have been passing under review have one common
characteristic: they are all performed in a state of confidence,
joy and even enthusiasm. Though the expectation of a future
and contingent event is not without a certain uncertainty, still
it is normal that the rain fall when the season for it comes, and
that the animal and vegetable species reproduce regularly. Oft-repeated
experiences have shown that the rites generally do
produce the effects which are expected of them and which are the
reason for their existence. Men celebrate them with confidence,
joyfully anticipating the happy event which they prepare and
announce. Whatever movements men perform participate in
this same state of mind: of course, they are marked with the
gravity which a religious solemnity always supposes, but this
gravity excludes neither animation nor joy.</p>

<p>These are all joyful feasts. But there are sad celebrations as
well, whose object is either to meet a calamity, or else merely
to commemorate and deplore it. These rites have a special
aspect, which we are going to attempt to characterize and explain.
It is the more necessary to study them by themselves since they
are going to reveal a new aspect of the religious life to us.</p>

<p>We propose to call the ceremonies of this sort piacular. The
term <i>piaculum</i> has the advantage that while it suggests the idea
of expiation, it also has a much more extended signification.
Every misfortune, everything of evil omen, everything that
inspires sentiments of sorrow or fear necessitates a <i>piaculum</i> and
is therefore called piacular.<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> So this word seems to be very well
adapted for designating the rites which are celebrated by those
in a state of uneasiness or sadness.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mourning offers us a first and important example of piacular rites.</p>

<p>However, a distinction is necessary between the different rites
which go to make up mourning. Some consist in mere abstentions:
it is forbidden to pronounce the name of the dead,<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> or to remain
near the place where the death occurred;<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> relatives, especially
the female ones, must abstain from all communication with
strangers;<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> the ordinary occupations of life are suspended, just
as in feast-time,<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> etc. All these practices belong to the negative
cult and are explained like the other rites of the same sort, so
they do not concern us at present. They are due to the fact that
the dead man is a sacred being. Consequently, everything which
is or has been connected with him is, by contagion, in a religious
state excluding all contact with things from profane life.</p>

<p>But mourning is not made up entirely of interdicts which have
to be observed. Positive acts are also demanded, in which the
relatives are both the actors and those acted upon.</p>

<p>Very frequently these rites commence as soon as the death
appears imminent. Here is a scene which Spencer and Gillen
witnessed among the Warramunga. A totemic ceremony had
just been celebrated and the company of actors and spectators
was leaving the consecrated ground when a piercing cry suddenly
came from the camp: a man was dying there. At once, the
whole company commenced to run as fast as they could, while
most of them commenced to howl. "Between us and the camp,"
say these observers, "lay a deep creek, and on the bank of this,
some of the men, scattered about here and there, sat down,
bending their heads forwards between their knees, while they
wept and moaned. Crossing the creek we found that, as usual,
the men's camp had been pulled to pieces. Some of the women,
who had come from every direction, were lying prostrate on the
body, while others were standing or kneeling around, digging the
sharp ends of yam-sticks into the crown of their heads, from
which the blood streamed down over their faces, while all the
time they kept up a loud, continuous wail. Many of the men,
rushing up to the spot, threw themselves upon the body, from
which the women arose when the men approached, until in a few
minutes we could see nothing but a struggling mass of bodies
all mixed up together. To one side, three men of the Thapungarti
class, who still wore their ceremonial decorations, sat down
wailing loudly, with their backs towards the dying man, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
a minute or two another man of the same class rushed on to the
ground yelling and brandishing a stone knife. Reaching the
camp, he suddenly gashed both thighs deeply, cutting right across
the muscles, and, unable to stand, fell down into the middle of
the group, from which he was dragged out after a time by three
or four female relatives, who immediately applied their mouths
to the gaping wounds while he lay exhausted on the ground."
The man did not actually die until late in the evening. As soon
as he had given up his last breath, the same scene was re-enacted,
only this time the wailing was still louder, and men and women,
seized by a veritable frenzy, were rushing about cutting themselves
with knives and sharp-pointed sticks, the women battering
one another's heads with fighting clubs, no one attempting to
ward off either cuts or blows. Finally, after about an hour, a
torchlight procession started off across the plain, to a tree in
whose branches the body was left.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>Howsoever great the violence of these manifestations may be,
they are strictly regulated by etiquette. The individuals who
make bloody incisions in themselves are designated by usage:
they must have certain relations of kinship with the dead man.
Thus, in the case observed by Spencer and Gillen among the
Warramunga, those who slashed their thighs were the maternal
grandfather of the deceased, his maternal uncle, and the maternal
uncle and brother of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Others must cut their whiskers
and hair, and then smear their scalps with pipe-clay. Women
have particularly severe obligations. They must cut their hair
and cover the whole body with pipe-clay; in addition to this, a
strict silence is imposed upon them during the whole period of
mourning, which may last as long as two years. It is not rare
among the Warramunga that, as a result of this interdiction, all
the women of a camp are condemned to the most absolute silence.
This becomes so habitual to them that even after the expiration
of the period of mourning, they voluntarily renounce all spoken
language and prefer to communicate with gestures&mdash;in which, by
the way, they acquire a remarkable ability. Spencer and Gillen
knew one old woman who had not spoken for over twenty-four
years.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>The ceremony which we have described opens a long series
of rites which succeed one another for weeks and even for months.
During the days which follow, they are renewed in various forms.
Groups of men and women sit on the ground, weeping and
lamenting, and kissing each other at certain moments. These
ritual kissings are repeated frequently during the period of
mourning. It seems as though men felt a need of coming close
together and communicating most closely; they are to be seen
holding to each other and wound together so much as to make one
single mass, from which loud groans escape.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> Meanwhile, the
women commence to lacerate their heads again, and, in order to
intensify the wounds they make, they even go so far as to burn
them with the points of fiery sticks.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>Practices of this sort are general in all Australia. The funeral
rites, that is, the ritual cares given to the corpse, the way in
which it is buried, etc., change with different tribes,<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> and in a
single tribe they vary with the age, sex and social importance of
the individual.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> But the real ceremonies of mourning repeat the
same theme everywhere; the variations are only in the details.
Everywhere we find this same silence interrupted by groans,<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>
the same obligation of cutting the hair and beard,<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> or of covering
one's head with pipe-clay or cinders, or perhaps even with excrements;<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>
everywhere, finally, we find this same frenzy for beating
one's self, lacerating one's self and burning one's self. In central
Victoria, "when death visits a tribe there is great weeping and
lamentation amongst the women, the elder portion of whom
lacerate their temples with their nails. The parents of the
deceased lacerate themselves fearfully, especially if it be an only
son whose loss they deplore. The father beats and cuts his head
with a tomahawk until he utters bitter groans, the mother sits
by the fire and burns her breasts and abdomen with a small fire-stick.
Sometimes the burns thus inflicted are so severe as to
cause death."<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>
<p>According to an account of Brough Smyth, here is what
happens in one of the southern tribes of the same state. As the
body is lowered into the grave, "the widow begins her sad ceremonies.
She cuts off her hair above her forehead, and becoming
frantic, seizes fire-sticks, and burns her breasts, arms, legs and
thighs. She seems to delight in the self-inflicted torture. It
would be rash and vain to interrupt her. When exhausted, and
when she can hardly walk, she yet endeavours to kick the embers
of the fire, and to throw them about. Sitting down, she takes
the ashes into her hands, rubs them into her wounds, and then
scratches her face (the only part not touched by the fire-sticks)
until the blood mingles with the ashes, which partly hide her
cruel wounds. In this plight, scratching her face continually,
she utters howls and lamentations."<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a></p>

<p>The description which Howitt gives of the rites of mourning
among the Kurnai is remarkably similar to these others. After
the body has been wrapped up in opossum skins and put in a
shroud of bark, a hut is built in which the relatives assemble.
"There they lay lamenting their loss, saying, for instance,
'Why did you leave us?' Now and then their grief would be
intensified by some one, for instance, the wife, uttering an ear-piercing
wail, 'My spouse is dead,' or another would say, 'My
child is dead.' All the others would then join in with the proper
term of relationship, and they would gash themselves with sharp
stones and tomahawks until their heads and bodies streamed
with blood. This bitter wailing and weeping continued all
night."<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>Sadness is not the only sentiment expressed during these
ceremonies; a sort of anger is generally mixed with it. The
relatives feel a need of avenging the death in some way or other.
They are to be seen throwing themselves upon one another and
trying to wound each other. Sometimes the attack is real;
sometimes it is only pretended.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> There are even cases when these
peculiar combats are organized. Among the Kaitish, the hair
of the deceased passes by right to his son-in-law. But he, in
return, must go, in company with some of his relatives and
friends, and provoke a quarrel with one of his tribal brothers,
that is, with a man belonging to the same matrimonial class as
himself and one who might therefore have married the daughter
of the dead man. This provocation cannot be refused and
the two combatants inflict serious wounds upon each other's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
shoulders and thighs. When the duel is terminated, the challenger
passes on to his adversary the hair which he had temporarily
inherited. This latter then provokes and fights with
another of his tribal brothers, to whom the precious relic is next
transmitted, but only provisionally; thus it passes from hand
to hand and circulates from group to group.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Also, something
of these same sentiments enters into that sort of rage with which
each relative beats himself, burns himself or slashes himself:
a sorrow which reaches such a paroxysm is not without a
certain amount of anger. One cannot fail to be struck by the
resemblances which these practices present to those of the
vendetta. Both proceed from the same principle that death
demands the shedding of blood. The only difference is that in
one case the victims are the relatives, while in the other they
are strangers. We do not have to treat especially of the vendetta,
which belongs rather to the study of juridic institutions; but it
should be pointed out, nevertheless, how it is connected with
the rites of mourning, whose end it announces.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a></p>

<p>In certain societies, the mourning is terminated by a ceremony
whose effervescence reaches or surpasses that produced by the
inaugural ceremonies. Among the Arunta, this closing rite is
called <i>Urpmilchima</i>. Spencer and Gillen assisted at two of these
rites. One was celebrated in honour of a man, the other of a
woman. Here is the description they give of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>They commence by making some ornaments of a special sort,
called <i>Chimurilia</i> by the men and <i>Aramurilia</i> by the women.
With a kind of resin, they fixed small animal bones, which had
previously been gathered and set aside, to locks of hair furnished
by the relatives of the dead woman. These are then attached to
one of the head-bands which women ordinarily wear and the
feathers of black cockatoos and parrots are added to it. When
these preparations are completed, the women assemble in their
camp. They paint their bodies different colours, according to
their degree of kinship with the deceased. After being embraced
by one another for some ten minutes, while uttering uninterrupted
groans, they set out for the tomb. At a certain distance, they
meet a brother by blood of the dead woman, who is accompanied
by some of his tribal brothers. Everybody sits down on the
ground, and the lamentations recommence. A <i>pitchi</i><a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> containing
the Chimurilia is then presented to the elder brother, who presses
it against his stomach; they say that this is a way of lessening
his sorrow. They take out one of the Chimurilia and the dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
woman's mother puts it on her head for a little while; then it
is put back into the <i>pitchi</i>, which each of the other men presses
against his breast, in his turn. Finally, the brother puts the
Chimurilia on the heads of two elder sisters and they set out
again for the tomb. On the way, the mother throws herself on
the ground several times, and tries to slash her head with a
pointed stick. Every time, the other women pick her up, and
seem to take care that she does not hurt herself too much.
When they arrive at the tomb, she throws herself on the knoll
and endeavours to destroy it with her hands, while the other
women literally dance upon her. The tribal mothers and aunts
(sisters of the dead woman's father) follow her example; they also
throw themselves on the ground, and mutually beat and tear each
other; finally their bodies are all streaming with blood. After a
while, they are dragged aside. The elder sisters then make
a hole in the earth of the tomb, in which they place the Chimurilia,
which had previously been torn to pieces. Once again the tribal
mothers throw themselves on the ground and slash each other's
heads. At this moment, "the weeping and wailing of the women
who were standing round seemed to drive them almost frenzied,
and the blood, streaming down their bodies over the white pipe-clay,
gave them a ghastly appearance. At last only the old
mother was left crouching alone, utterly exhausted and moaning
weakly on the grave."<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> Then the others raised her up and rubbed
off the pipe-clay with which she was covered; this was the end
of the ceremony and of the mourning.<a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<p>Among the Warramunga, the final rite presents some rather
particular characteristics. There seems to be no shedding of
blood here, but the collective effervescence is translated in
another manner.</p>

<p>Among his people, before the body is definitely interred, it
is exposed upon a platform placed in the branches of a tree;
it is left there to decompose slowly, until nothing remains but
the bones. Then these are gathered together and, with the
exception of the humerus, they are placed inside an ant-hill.
The humerus is wrapped up in a bark box, which is decorated in
different manners. The box is then brought to camp, amid the
cries and groans of the women. During the following days, they
celebrate a series of totemic rites, concerning the totem of the
deceased and the mythical history of the ancestors from whom
the clan is descended. When all these ceremonies have been
terminated, they proceed to the closing rite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>A trench one foot deep and fifteen feet long is dug in the field of
the ceremony. A design representing the totem of the deceased
and certain spots where the ancestor stopped is made on the
ground a little distance from it. Near this design, a little ditch
is dug in the ground. Ten decorated men then advance, one
behind another, and with their hands crossed behind their heads
and their legs wide apart they stand astraddle the trench. At a
given signal, the women run from the camp in a profound silence;
when they are near, they form in Indian file, the last one holding
in her hands the box containing the humerus. Then, after
throwing themselves on the ground, they advance on their hands
and knees, and pass all along the trench, between the legs of the
men. The scene shows a state of great sexual excitement. As
soon as the last woman has passed, they take the box from her,
and take it to the ditch, near which is an old man; he breaks the
bone with a sharp blow, and hurriedly buries it in the debris.
During this time, the women have remained at a distance, with
their backs turned upon the scene, for they must not see it. But
when they hear the blow of the axe, they flee, uttering cries and
groans. The rite is accomplished; the mourning is terminated.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>These rites belong to a very different type from those which
we have studied hitherto. We do not mean to say that important
resemblances cannot be found between the two, which we shall
have to note; but the differences are more apparent. Instead
of happy dances, songs and dramatic representations which
distract and relax the mind, they are tears and groans and, in a
word, the most varied manifestations of agonized sorrow and a
sort of mutual pity, which occupy the whole scene. Of course
the shedding of blood also takes place in the Intichiuma, but this
is an oblation made with a movement of pious enthusiasm.
Even though the motions may be the same, the sentiments
expressed are different and even opposed. Likewise, the ascetic
rites certainly imply privations, abstinences and mutilations,
but ones which must be borne with an impassive firmness and
serenity. Here, on the contrary, dejection, cries and tears are
the rule. The ascetic tortures himself in order to prove, in his
own eyes and those of his fellows, that he is above suffering.
During mourning, men injure themselves to prove that they
suffer. By all these signs, the characteristic traits of the piacular
rites are to be recognized.</p>

<p>But how are they to be explained?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>One initial fact is constant: mourning is not the spontaneous
expression of individual emotions.<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> If the relations weep, lament,
mutilate themselves, it is not because they feel themselves
personally affected by the death of their kinsman. Of course, it
may be that in certain particular cases, the chagrin expressed is
really felt.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> But it is more generally the case that there is no
connection between the sentiments felt and the gestures made
by the actors in the rite.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> If, at the very moment when the
weepers seem the most overcome by their grief, some one speaks
to them of some temporal interest, it frequently happens that
they change their features and tone at once, take on a laughing
air and converse in the gayest fashion imaginable.<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> Mourning
is not a natural movement of private feelings wounded by a cruel
loss; it is a duty imposed by the group. One weeps, not simply
because he is sad, but because he is forced to weep. It is a ritual
attitude which he is forced to adopt out of respect for custom,
but which is, in a large measure, independent of his affective
state. Moreover, this obligation is sanctioned by mythical or
social penalties. They believe, for example, that if a relative
does not mourn as is fitting, then the soul of the departed follows
upon his steps and kills him.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> In other cases, society does not
leave it to the religious forces to punish the negligent; it intervenes
itself, and reprimands the ritual faults. If a son-in-law
does not render to his father-in-law the funeral attentions which
are due him, and if he does not make the prescribed incisions,
then his tribal fathers-in-law take his wife away from him and
give him another.<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> Therefore, in order to square himself with
usage, a man sometimes forces tears to flow by artificial means.<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a></p>

<p>Whence comes this obligation?</p>

<p>Ethnographers and sociologists are generally satisfied with the
reply which the natives themselves give to this question. They
say that the dead wish to be lamented, that by refusing them the
tribute of sorrow which is their right, men offend them, and that
the only way of preventing their anger is to conform to their
will.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>But this mythological interpretation merely modifies the
terms of the problem, without resolving it; it is still necessary
to explain why the dead imperatively reclaim the mourning. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
may be said that it is natural for men to wish to be mourned and
regretted. But in making this sentiment explain the complex
system of rites which make up mourning, we attribute to the
Australian affective exigencies of which the civilized man himself
does not always give evidence. Let us admit&mdash;as is not evident
<i>a priori</i>&mdash;that the idea of not being forgotten too readily is
pleasing to a man who thinks of the future. It is still to be
established that it has ever had enough importance in the minds
of the living for one to attribute to the dead a state of mind
proceeding almost entirely from this preoccupation. It seems
especially improbable that such a sentiment could obsess and
impassion men who are seldom accustomed to thinking beyond
the present moment. So far is it from being a fact that the desire
to survive in the memory of those who are still alive is to be
regarded as the origin of mourning, that we may even ask ourselves
whether it was not rather mourning itself which, when
once established, aroused the idea of and the taste for posthumous
regrets.</p>

<p>The classic interpretation appears still more unsustainable
when we know what the primitive mourning consists in. It is
not made up merely of pious regrets accorded to him who no
longer is, but also of severe abstinences and cruel sacrifices. The
rite does not merely demand that one think of the deceased in a
melancholy way, but also that he beat himself, bruise himself,
lacerate himself and burn himself. We have even seen that
persons in mourning sometimes torture themselves to such a
degree that they do not survive their wounds. What reason has
the dead man for imposing such torments upon them? Such a
cruelty on his part denotes something more than a desire not to
be forgotten. If he is to find pleasure in seeing his own suffer, it
is necessary that he hate them, that he be thirsty for their blood.
This ferocity would undoubtedly appear natural to those for
whom every spirit is necessarily an evil and redoubted power.
But we know that there are spirits of every sort; how does it
happen that the soul of the dead man is necessarily an evil
spirit? As long as the man is alive, he loves his relatives and
exchanges services with them. Is it not strange that as soon as
it is freed from his body, his soul should instantly lay aside its
former sentiments and become an evil and tormenting genius?
It is a general rule that the dead man retains the personality of
the living, and that he has the same character, the same hates
and the same affections. So this metamorphosis is not easily
understandable by itself. It is true that the natives admit it
implicitly when they explain the rite by the exigencies of the
dead man, but the question now before us is to know whence this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
conception came. Far from being capable of being regarded as
a truism, it is as obscure as the rite itself, and consequently
cannot account for it.</p>

<p>Finally, even if we had found the reasons for this surprising
transformation, we would still have to explain why it is only
temporary. For it does not last beyond the period of mourning;
after the rites have once been accomplished, the dead man
becomes what he was when alive, an affectionate and devoted
relation. He puts the new powers which he receives from his
new condition at the service of his friends.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> Thenceforth, he is
regarded as a good genius, always ready to aid those whom he was
recently tormenting. Whence come these successive transfers?
If the evil sentiments attributed to the soul come solely from the
fact that it is no longer in life, they should remain invariable,
and if the mourning is due to this, it should be interminable.</p>

<p>These mythical explanations express the idea which the
native has of the rite, and not the rite itself. So we may set
them aside and face the reality which they translate, though
disfiguring it in doing so. If mourning differs from the other
forms of the positive cult, there is one feature in which it resembles
them: it, too, is made up out of collective ceremonies which
produce a state of effervescence among those who take part in
them. The sentiments aroused are different; but the arousal is
the same. So it is presumable that the explanation of the joyous
rites is capable of being applied to the sad rites, on condition that
the terms be transposed.</p>

<p>When some one dies, the family group to which he belongs
feels itself lessened and, to react against this loss, it assembles.
A common misfortune has the same effects as the approach of a
happy event: collective sentiments are renewed which then lead
men to seek one another and to assemble together. We have
even seen this need for concentration affirm itself with a particular
energy: they embrace one another, put their arms round
one another, and press as close as possible to one another. But the
affective state in which the group then happens to be only
reflects the circumstances through which it is passing. Not only
do the relatives, who are effected the most directly, bring their
own personal sorrow to the assembly, but the society exercises
a moral pressure over its members, to put their sentiments in
harmony with the situation. To allow them to remain indifferent
to the blow which has fallen upon it and diminished it, would be
equivalent to proclaiming that it does not hold the place in their
hearts which is due it; it would be denying itself. A family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
which allows one of its members to die without being wept for
shows by that very fact that it lacks moral unity and cohesion:
it abdicates; it renounces its existence. An individual in his
turn, if he is strongly attached to the society of which he is a
member, feels that he is morally held to participating in its
sorrows and joys; not to be interested in them would be
equivalent to breaking the bonds uniting him to the group; it
would be renouncing all desire for it and contradicting himself.
When the Christian, during the ceremonies commemorating the
Passion, and the Jew, on the anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem,
fast and mortify themselves, it is not in giving way to a sadness
which they feel spontaneously. Under these circumstances, the
internal state of the believer is out of all proportion to the severe
abstinences to which they submit themselves. If he is sad, it is
primarily because he consents to being sad, and he consents to
it in order to affirm his faith. The attitude of the Australian
during mourning is to be explained in the same way. If he
weeps and groans, it is not merely to express an individual
chagrin; it is to fulfil a duty of which the surrounding society
does not fail to remind him.</p>

<p>We have seen elsewhere how human sentiments are intensified
when affirmed collectively. Sorrow, like joy, becomes exalted
and amplified when leaping from mind to mind, and therefore
expresses itself outwardly in the form of exuberant and violent
movements. But these are no longer expressive of the joyful
agitation which we observed before; they are shrieks and cries
of pain. Each is carried along by the others; a veritable panic
of sorrow results. When pain reaches this degree of intensity,
it is mixed with a sort of anger and exasperation. One feels the
need of breaking something, of destroying something. He takes
this out either upon himself or others. He beats himself, burns
himself, wounds himself or else he falls upon others to beat,
burn and wound them. Thus it became the custom to give one's
self up to the veritable orgies of tortures during mourning. It
seems very probable that blood-revenge and head-hunting have
their origin in this. If every death is attributed to some magic
charm, and for this reason it is believed that the dead man ought
to be avenged, it is because men must find a victim at any price,
upon whom the collective pain and anger may be discharged.
Naturally this victim is sought outside the group; a stranger
is a subject <i>minoris resistenti&aelig;</i>; as he is not protected by the
sentiments of sympathy inspired by a relative or neighbour,
there is nothing in him which subdues and neutralizes the evil
and destructive sentiments aroused by the death. It is undoubtedly
for this same reason that women serve more frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
than men as the passive objects of the cruellest rites of mourning;
since they have a smaller social value, they are more obviously
designated as scapegoats.</p>

<p>We see that this explanation of mourning completely leaves
aside all ideas of souls or spirits. The only forces which are
really active are of a wholly impersonal nature: they are the
emotions aroused in the group by the death of one of its members.
But the primitive does not know the psychical mechanism
from which these practices result. So when he tries to account
for them, he is obliged to forge a wholly different explanation.
All he knows is that he must painfully mortify himself. As
every obligation suggests the notion of a will which obliges,
he looks about him to see whence this constraint which he feels
may come. Now, there is one moral power, of whose reality
he is assured and which seems designated for this r&ocirc;le: this is
the soul which the death has liberated. For what could have a
greater interest than it in the effects which its own death has on
the living? So they imagine that if these latter inflict an unnatural
treatment upon themselves, it is to conform to its
exigencies. It was thus that the idea of the soul must have
intervened at a later date into the mythology of mourning.
But also, since it is thus endowed with inhuman exigencies,
it must be supposed that in leaving the body which it animated,
the soul lays aside every human sentiment. Hence the metamorphosis
which makes a dreaded enemy out of the relative of
yesterday. This transformation is not the origin of mourning;
it is rather its consequence. It translates a change which has
come over the affective state of the group: men do not weep
for the dead because they fear them; they fear them because
they weep for them.</p>

<p>But this change of the affective state can only be a temporary
one, for while the ceremonies of mourning result from it, they
also put an end to it. Little by little, they neutralize the very
causes which have given rise to them. The foundation of mourning
is the impression of a loss which the group feels when it loses
one of its members. But this very impression results in bringing
individuals together, in putting them into closer relations with
one another, in associating them all in the same mental state,
and therefore in disengaging a sensation of comfort which compensates
the original loss.&mdash;Since they weep together, they hold
to one another and the group is not weakened, in spite of the
blow which has fallen upon it. Of course they have only sad
emotions in common, but communicating in sorrow is still communicating,
and every communion of mind, in whatever form it
may be made, raises the social vitality. The exceptional violence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
of the manifestations by which the common pain is necessarily
and obligatorily expressed even testifies to the fact that at this
moment, the society is more alive and active than ever. In
fact, whenever the social sentiment is painfully wounded, it
reacts with greater force than ordinarily: one never holds so
closely to his family as when it has just suffered. This surplus
energy effaces the more completely the effects of the interruption
which was felt at first, and thus dissipates the feeling of coldness
which death always brings with it. The group feels its strength
gradually returning to it; it begins to hope and to live again.
Presently one stops mourning, and he does so owing to the mourning
itself. But as the idea formed of the soul reflects the moral
state of the society, this idea should change as this state changes.
When one is in the period of dejection and agony, he represents
the soul with the traits of an evil being, whose sole occupation
is to persecute men. But when he feels himself confident and
secure once more, he must admit that it has retaken its former
nature and its former sentiments of tenderness and solidarity.
Thus we explain the very different ways in which it is conceived
at different moments of its existence.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a></p>

<p>Not only do the rites of mourning determine certain of the
secondary characteristics attributed to the soul, but perhaps
they are not foreign to the idea that it survives the body. If he
is to understand the practices to which he submits on the death
of a parent, a man is obliged to believe that these are not an
indifferent matter for the deceased. The shedding of blood
which is practised so freely during mourning is a veritable
sacrifice offered to the dead man.<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> So something of the dead
man must survive, and as this is not the body, which is manifestly
immobile and decomposed, it can only be the soul. Of
course it is impossible to say with any exactness what part
these considerations have had in the origin of the idea of immortality.
But it is probable that here the influence of the cult is
the same as it is elsewhere. Rites are more easily explicable
when one imagines that they are addressed to personal beings;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
so men have been induced to extend the influence of the mythical
personalities in the religious life. In order to account for mourning,
they have prolonged the existence of the soul beyond the
tomb. This is one more example of the way in which rites react
upon beliefs.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>But death is not the only event which may disturb a community.
Men have many other occasions for being sorry and
lamenting, so we might foresee that even the Australians would
know and practise other piacular rites besides mourning. However,
it is a remarkable fact that only a small number of examples
are to be found in the accounts of the observers.</p>

<p>One rite of this sort greatly resembles those which have just
been studied. It will be remembered that among the Arunta,
each local group attributes exceptionally important virtues to
its collection of churinga: this is this collective palladium,
upon whose fate the fate of the community itself is believed
to depend. So when enemies or white men succeed in stealing
one of these religious treasures, this loss is considered a public
calamity. This misfortune is the occasion of a rite having all
the characteristics of mourning: men smear their bodies with
white pipe-clay and remain in camp, weeping and lamenting,
during a period of two weeks.<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> This is a new proof that mourning
is determined, not by the way in which the soul of the dead is
conceived, but by impersonal causes, by the moral state of the
group. In fact, we have here a rite which, in its structure, is
indistinguishable from the real mourning, but which is, nevertheless,
independent of every notion of spirits or evil-working
demons.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>Another circumstance which gives occasion for ceremonies
of the same nature is the distress in which the society finds
itself after an insufficient harvest. "The natives who live in
the vicinity of Lake Eyre," says Eylmann, "also seek to prevent
an insufficiency of food by means of secret ceremonies. But
many of the ritual practices observed in this region are to be
distinguished from those which have been mentioned already:
it is not by symbolic dances, by imitative movements nor dazzling
decorations that they try to act upon the religious powers
or the forces of nature, but by means of the suffering which
individuals inflict upon themselves. In the northern territories,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
it is by means of tortures, such as prolonged fasts, vigils, dances
persisted up to the exhaustion of the dancers, and physical
pains of every sort, that they attempt to appease the powers
which are ill-disposed towards men."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> The torments to which
the natives submit themselves for this purpose sometimes
leave them in such a state of exhaustion that they are unable
to follow the hunt for some days to come.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></p>

<p>These practices are employed especially for fighting against
drought. This is because a scarcity of water results in a general
want. To remedy this evil, they have recourse to violent methods.
One which is frequently used is the extraction of a tooth. Among
the Kaitish, for example, they pull out an incisor from one man,
and hang it on a tree.<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> Among the Dieri, the idea of rain is
closely associated with that of bloody incisions made in the skin
of the chest and arms.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> Among this same people, whenever the
drought is very great, the great council assembles and summons
the whole tribe. It is really a tribal event. Women are sent
in every direction to notify men to assemble at a given place
and time. After they have assembled, they groan and cry in a
piercing voice about the miserable state of the land, and they
beg the <i>Mura-mura</i> (the mythical ancestors) to give them the
power of making an abundant rain fall.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> In the cases, which,
by the way, are very rare, when there has been an excessive
rainfall, an analogous ceremony takes place to stop it. Old
men then enter into a veritable frenzy,<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> while the cries uttered
by the crowd are really painful to hear.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<p>Spencer and Gillen describe, under the name of Intichiuma,
a ceremony which may well have the same object and the same
origin as the preceding ones: a physical torture is applied to
make an animal species multiply. Among the Urabunna, there
is one clan whose totem is a variety of snake called <i>wadnungadni</i>.
This is how the chief of the clan proceeds, to make sure that
these snakes may never be lacking. After having been decorated,
he kneels down on the ground, holding his arms straight out.
An assistant pinches the skin of his right arm between his fingers,
and the officiant forces a pointed bone five inches long through
the fold thus formed. This self-mutilation is believed to produce
the desired result.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> An analogous rite is used among the Dieri
to make the wild-hens lay: the operators pierce their scrotums.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
In certain of the Lake Eyre tribes, men pierce their ears to make
yams reproduce.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a></p>

<p>But these partial or total famines are not the only plagues
which may fall upon a tribe. Other events happen more or
less periodically which menace, or seem to menace, the existence
of the group. This is the case, for example, with the southern
lights. The Kurnai believe that this is a fire lighted in the
heavens by the great god Mungan-ngaua; therefore, whenever
they see it, they are afraid that it may spread to the earth and
devour them, so a great effervescence results in the camp. They
shake a withered hand, to which the Kurnai attribute various
virtues, and utter such cries as "Send it away; do not let us
be burned." At the same time, the old men order an exchange
of wives, which always indicates a great excitement.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> The
same sexual licence is mentioned among the Wiimbaio whenever
a plague appears imminent, and especially in times of an
epidemic.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>Under the influence of these ideas, mutilations and the shedding
of blood are sometimes considered an efficient means of curing
maladies. If an accident happens to a child among the Dieri, his
relations beat themselves on the head with clubs or boomerangs
until the blood flows down over their faces. They believe that
by this process, they relieve the child of the suffering.<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> Elsewhere,
they imagine that they can obtain the same end by means
of a supplementary totemic ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> We may connect with
these the example already given of a ceremony celebrated
specially to efface the effects of a ritual fault.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> Of course there
are neither wounds nor blows nor physical suffering of any sort
in these two latter cases, yet the rite does not differ in nature
from the others: the end sought is always the turning aside of
an evil or the expiation of a fault by means of an extraordinary
ritual prestation.</p>

<p>Outside of mourning, such are the only cases of piacular
rites which we have succeeded in finding in Australia. To be
sure, it is probable that some have escaped us, while we may
presume equally well that others have remained unperceived
by the observers. But if those discovered up to the present
are few in number, it is probably because they do not hold a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
large place in the cult. We see how far primitive religions are
from being the daughters of agony and fear from the fact that
the rites translating these painful emotions are relatively rare.
Of course this is because the Australian, while leading a miserable
existence as compared with other more civilized peoples, demands
so little of life that he is easily contented. All that he asks is
that nature follow its normal course, that the seasons succeed
one another regularly, that the rain fall, at the ordinary time,
in abundance and without excess. Now great disturbances in
the cosmic order are always exceptional; thus it is noticeable
that the majority of the regular piacular rites, examples of which
we have given above, have been observed in the tribes of the
centre, where droughts are frequent and constitute veritable
disasters. It is still surprising, it is true, that piacular rites
specially destined to expiate sins, seem to be completely lacking.
However, the Australian, like every other man, must commit
ritual faults, which he has an interest in redeeming; so we may
ask if the silence of the texts on this point may not be due to
insufficient observation.</p>

<p>But howsoever few the facts which we have been able to gather
may be, they are, nevertheless, instructive.</p>

<p>When we study piacular rites in the more advanced religions,
where the religious forces are individualized, they appear to be
closely bound up with anthropomorphic conceptions. When
the believer imposes privations upon himself and submits himself
to austerities, it is in order to disarm the malevolence
attributed by him to certain of the sacred beings upon whom
he thinks that he is dependent. To appease their hatred or
anger, he complies with their exigencies; he beats himself in
order that he may not be beaten by them. So it seems as though
these practices could not arise until after gods and spirits were
conceived as moral persons, capable of passions analogous to
those of men. For this reason, Robertson Smith thought it
possible to assign a relatively late date to expiatory sacrifices,
just as to sacrificial oblations. According to him, the shedding
of blood which characterizes these rites was at first a simple
process of communion: men poured forth their blood upon
the altar in order to strengthen the bonds uniting them to their
god. The rite acquired a piacular and penal character only when
its original significance was forgotten and when the new idea
which was formed of sacred beings allowed men to attribute
another function to it.<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a></p>

<p>But as piacular rites are met with even in the Australian
societies, it is impossible to assign them so late an origin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Moreover, all that we have observed, with one single exception,<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>
are independent of all anthropomorphic conceptions: there is
no question of either spirits or gods. Abstinences and effusions
of blood stop famines and cure sicknesses directly and by themselves.
No spiritual being introduces his action between the rite
and the effect it is believed to produce. So mythical personalities
intervened only at a late date. After the mechanism of the
ritual had once been established, they served to make it more
easily representable in the mind, but they are not conditions
of its existence. It is for other reasons that it was founded;
it is to another cause that it owes its efficacy.</p>

<p>It acts through the collective forces which it puts into play.
Does a misfortune which menaces the group appear imminent?
Then the group unites, as in the case of mourning, and it is
naturally an impression of uneasiness and perplexity which
dominates the assembled body. Now, as always, the pooling
of these sentiments results in intensifying them. By affirming
themselves, they exalt and impassion themselves and attain a
degree of violence which is translated by the corresponding
violence of the gestures which express them. Just as at the death
of a relative, they utter terrible cries, fly into a passion and feel
that they must tear and destroy; it is to satisfy this need that they
beat themselves, wound themselves, and make their blood flow.
When emotions have this vivacity, they may well be painful, but
they are not depressing; on the contrary, they denote a state
of effervescence which implies a mobilization of all our active
forces, and even a supply of external energies. It matters little
that this exaltation was provoked by a sad event, for it is real,
notwithstanding, and does not differ specifically from what
is observed in the happy feasts. Sometimes it is even made
manifest by movements of the same nature: there is the same
frenzy which seizes the worshippers and the same tendency
towards sexual debauches, a sure sign of great nervous over-excitement.
Robertson Smith had already noticed this curious
influence of sad rites in the Semitic cults: "in evil times," he
says, "when men's thoughts were habitually sombre, they
betook themselves to the physical excitement of religion as men
now take refuge in wine.... And so in general when an act of
Semitic worship began with sorrow and lamentation&mdash;as in the
mourning for Adonis, or the great atoning ceremonies which
became common in later times&mdash;a swift revulsion of feeling
followed, and the gloomy part of the service was presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
succeeded by a burst of hilarious revelry."<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> In a word, even
when religious ceremonies have a disquieting or saddening event
as their point of departure, they retain their stimulating power
over the affective state of the group and individuals. By the
mere fact that they are collective, they raise the vital tone.
When one feels life within him&mdash;whether it be in the form of
painful irritation or happy enthusiasm&mdash;he does not believe
in death; so he becomes reassured and takes courage again,
and subjectively, everything goes on as if the rite had really
driven off the danger which was dreaded. This is how curing
or preventive virtues come to be attributed to the movements
which one makes, to the cries uttered, to the blood shed and to
the wounds inflicted upon one's self or others; and as these
different tortures necessarily make one suffer, suffering by itself
is finally regarded as a means of conjuring evil or curing sickness.<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>
Later, when the majority of the religious forces had taken the
form of moral personalities, the efficacy of these practices was
explained by imagining that their object was to appease an
evil-working or irritated god. But these conceptions only reflect
the rite and the sentiments it arouses; they are an interpretation
of it, not its determining cause.</p>

<p>A negligence of the ritual acts in the same way. It, too, is a
menace for the group; it touches it in its moral existence for
it touches it in its beliefs. But if the anger which it causes is
affirmed ostensibly and energetically, it compensates the evil
which it has caused. For if it is acutely felt by all, it is because
the infraction committed is an exception and the common faith
remains entire. So the moral unity of the group is not endangered.
Now the penalty inflicted as an expiation is only a manifestation
of the public anger, the material proof of its unanimity. So it
really does have the healing effect attributed to it. At bottom,
the sentiment which is at the root of the real expiatory rites
does not differ in nature from that which we have found at the
basis of the other piacular rites: it is a sort of irritated sorrow
which tends to manifest itself by acts of destruction. Sometimes
it is assuaged to the detriment of him who feels it; sometimes
it is at the expense of some foreign third party. But in either
case, the psychic mechanism is essentially the same.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>One of the greatest services which Robertson Smith has
rendered to the science of religions is to have pointed out the
ambiguity of the notion of sacredness.</p>

<p>Religious forces are of two sorts. Some are beneficent,
guardians of the physical and moral order, dispensers of life
and health and all the qualities which men esteem: this is the
case with the totemic principle, spread out in the whole species,
the mythical ancestor, the animal-protector, the civilizing
heroes and the tutelar gods of every kind and degree. It matters
little whether they are conceived as distinct personalities or as
diffused energies; under either form they fulfil the same function
and affect the minds of the believers in the same way: the
respect which they inspire is mixed with love and gratitude.
The things and the persons which are normally connected with
them participate in the same sentiments and the same character:
these are holy things and persons. Such are the spots consecrated
to the cult, the objects which serve in the regular rites, the priests,
the ascetics, etc.&mdash;On the other hand, there are evil and impure
powers, productive of disorders, causes of death and sickness,
instigators of sacrilege. The only sentiments which men have for
them are a fear into which horror generally enters. Such are
the forces upon which and by which the sorcerer acts, those
which arise from corpses or the menstrual blood, those freed
by every profanation of sacred things, etc. The spirits of the
dead and malign genii of every sort are their personified forms.</p>

<p>Between these two categories of forces and beings, the
contrast is as complete as possible and even goes into the
most radical antagonism. The good and salutary powers repel
to a distance these others which deny and contradict them.
Therefore the former are forbidden to the latter: any contact
between them is considered the worst of profanations. This is
the typical form of those interdicts between sacred things of
different species, the existence of which we have already pointed
out.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Women during menstruation, and especially at its
beginning, are impure; so at this moment they are rigorously
sequestered; men may have no relations with them.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> Bull-roarers
and churinga never come near a dead man.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> A sacrilegious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
person is excluded from the society of the faithful; access
to the cult is forbidden him. Thus the whole religious life
gravitates about two contrary poles between which there is the
same opposition as between the pure and the impure, the saint
and the sacrilegious, the divine and the diabolic.</p>

<p>But while these two aspects of the religious life oppose one
another, there is a close kinship between them. In the first
place, both have the same relation towards profane beings:
these must abstain from all contact with impure things just
as from the most holy things. The former are no less forbidden
than the latter: they are withdrawn from circulation alike.
This shows that they too are sacred. Of course the sentiments
inspired by the two are not identical: respect is one thing,
disgust and horror another. Yet, if the gestures are to be the
same in both cases, the sentiments expressed must not differ in
nature. And, in fact, there is a horror in religious respect, especially
when it is very intense, while the fear inspired by malign
powers is generally not without a certain reverential character.
The shades by which these two attitudes are differentiated are
even so slight sometimes that it is not always easy to say which
state of mind the believers actually happen to be in. Among
certain Semitic peoples, pork was forbidden, but it was not
always known exactly whether this was because it was a pure
or an impure thing<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> and the same may be said of a very large
number of alimentary interdictions.</p>

<p>But there is more to be said; it very frequently happens
that an impure thing or an evil power becomes a holy thing or
a guardian power, without changing its nature, through a simple
modification of external circumstances. We have seen how
the soul of a dead man, which is a dreaded principle at first,
is transformed into a protecting genius as soon as the mourning
is finished. Likewise, the corpse, which begins by inspiring
terror and aversion, is later regarded as a venerated relic: funeral
anthropophagy, which is frequently practised in the Australian
societies, is a proof of this transformation.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> The totemic animal
is the pre-eminently sacred being; but for him who eats its
flesh unduly, it is a cause of death. In a general way, the sacrilegious
person is merely a profane one who has been infected
with a benevolent religious force. This changes its nature in
changing its habitat; it defiles rather than sanctifies.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
blood issuing from the genital organs of a woman, though it is
evidently as impure as that of menstruation, is frequently
used as a remedy against sickness.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> The victim immolated in
expiatory sacrifices is charged with impurities, for they have
concentrated upon it the sins which were to be expiated. Yet,
after it has been slaughtered, its flesh and blood are employed
for the most pious uses.<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> On the contrary, though the communion
is generally a religious operation whose normal function
is to consecrate, it sometimes produces the effects of a sacrilege.
In certain cases, the persons who have communicated are forced
to flee from one another as from men infected with a plague.
One would say that they have become a source of dangerous
contamination for one another: the sacred bond which unites
them also separates them. Examples of this sort of communion
are numerous in Australia. One of the most typical has been
observed among the Narrinyeri and the neighbouring tribes.
When an infant arrives in the world, its parents carefully preserve
its umbilical cord, which is believed to conceal a part of its soul.
Two persons who exchange the cords thus preserved communicate
together by the very act of this exchange, for it is as though they
exchanged their souls. But, at the same time, they are forbidden
to touch or speak to or even to see one another. It is just as
though they were each an object of horror for the other.<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a></p>

<p>So the pure and the impure are not two separate classes, but
two varieties of the same class, which includes all sacred things.
There are two sorts of sacredness, the propitious and the unpropitious,
and not only is there no break of continuity between
these two opposed forms, but also one object may pass from the
one to the other without changing its nature. The pure is made
out of the impure, and reciprocally. It is in the possibility of
these transmutations that the ambiguity of the sacred consists.</p>

<p>But even if Robertson Smith did have an active sentiment
of this ambiguity, he never gave it an express explanation. He
confined himself to remarking that, as all religious forces are
indistinctly intense and contagious, it is wise not to approach
them except with respectful precautions, no matter what direction
their action may be exercised in. It seemed to him that he could
thus account for the air of kinship which they all present, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
spite of the contrasts which oppose them otherwise. But the
question was only put off; it still remains to be shown how it
comes that the powers of evil have the same intensity and
contagiousness as the others. In other words, how does it happen
that they, too, are of a religious nature? Also, the energy and
force of expansion which they have in common do not enable
us to understand how, in spite of the conflict which divides them,
they may be transformed into one another or substituted for
each other in their respective functions, and how the pure may
contaminate while the impure sometimes serves to sanctify.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<p>The explanation of piacular rites which we have proposed
enables us to reply to this double question.</p>

<p>We have seen, in fact, that the evil powers are the product
of these rites and symbolize them. When a society is going
through circumstances which sadden, perplex or irritate it,
it exercises a pressure over its members, to make them bear
witness, by significant acts, to their sorrow, perplexity or anger.
It imposes upon them the duty of weeping, groaning or inflicting
wounds upon themselves or others, for these collective
manifestations, and the moral communion which they show
and strengthen, restore to the group the energy which circumstances
threaten to take away from it, and thus they enable
it to become settled. This is the experience which men interpret
when they imagine that outside them there are evil beings
whose hostility, whether constitutional or temporary, can be
appeased only by human suffering. These beings are nothing
other than collective states objectified; they are society itself
seen under one of its aspects. But we also know that the benevolent
powers are constituted in the same way; they, too, result
from the collective life and express it; they, too, represent the
society, but seen from a very different attitude, to wit, at the
moment when it confidently affirms itself and ardently presses
on towards the realization of the ends which it pursues. Since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
these two sorts of forces have a common origin, it is not at all
surprising that, though facing in opposite directions, they should
have the same nature, that they are equally intense and contagious
and consequently forbidden and sacred.</p>

<p>From this we are able to understand how they change into one
another. Since they reflect the abjective state in which the group
happens to be, it is enough that this state change for their
character to change. After the mourning is over, the domestic
group is re-calmed by the mourning itself; it regains confidence;
the painful pressure which they felt exercised over them is relieved;
they feel more at their ease. So it seems to them as
though the spirit of the deceased had laid aside its hostile sentiments
and become a benevolent protector. The other transmutations,
examples of which we have cited, are to be explained
in the same way. As we have already shown, the sanctity of a
thing is due to the collective sentiment of which it is the object.
If, in violation of the interdicts which isolate it, it comes in contact
with a profane person, then this same sentiment will spread
contagiously to this latter and imprint a special character upon
him. But in spreading, it comes into a very different state from
the one it was in at first. Offended and irritated by the profanation
implied in this abusive and unnatural extension, it
becomes aggressive and inclined to destructive violences: it
tends to avenge itself for the offence suffered. Therefore the
infected subject seems to be filled with a mighty and harmful
force which menaces all that approaches him; it is as though
he were marked with a stain or blemish. Yet the cause of this
blemish is the same psychic state which, in other circumstances,
consecrates and sanctifies. But if the anger thus aroused is
satisfied by an expiatory rite, it subsides, alleviated; the offended
sentiment is appeased and returns to its original state. So it
acts once more as it acted in the beginning; instead of contaminating,
it sanctifies. As it continues to infect the object
to which it is attached, this could never become profane and
religiously indifferent again. But the direction of the religious
force with which it seems to be filled is inverted: from being
impure, it has become pure and an instrument of purification.</p>

<p>In r&eacute;sum&eacute;, the two poles of the religious life correspond to
the two opposed states through which all social life passes.
Between the propitiously sacred and the unpropitiously sacred
there is the same contrast as between the states of collective
well-being and ill-being. But since both are equally collective,
there is, between the mythological constructions symbolizing
them, an intimate kinship of nature. The sentiments held in
common vary from extreme dejection to extreme joy, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
painful irritation to ecstatic enthusiasm; but, in any case,
there is a communion of minds and a mutual comfort resulting
from this communion. The fundamental process is always the
same; only circumstances colour it differently. So, at bottom,
it is the unity and the diversity of social life which make the
simultaneous unity and diversity of sacred beings and things.</p>

<p>This ambiguity, moreover, is not peculiar to the idea of sacredness
alone; something of this characteristic has been found in
all the rites which we have been studying. Of course it was
essential to distinguish them; to confuse them would have been
to misunderstand the multiple aspects of the religious life. But,
on the other hand, howsoever different they may be, there is no
break of continuity between them. Quite on the contrary, they
overlap one another and may even replace each other mutually.
We have already shown how the rites of oblation and communion,
the imitative rites and the commemorative rites frequently
fulfil the same function. One might imagine that the
negative cult, at least, would be more sharply separated from
the positive cult; yet we have seen that the former may produce
positive effects, identical with those produced by the latter.
The same results are obtained by fasts, abstinences and self-mutilations
as by communions, oblations and commemorations.
Inversely, offerings and sacrifices imply privations and renunciations
of every sort. The continuity between ascetic and
piacular rites is even more apparent: both are made up of sufferings,
accepted or undergone, to which an analogous efficacy is
attributed. Thus the practices, like the beliefs, are not arranged
in two separate classes. Howsoever complex the outward
manifestations of the religious life may be, at bottom it is one
and simple. It responds everywhere to one and the same need,
and is everywhere derived from one and the same mental state.
In all its forms, its object is to raise man above himself and to
make him lead a life superior to that which he would lead, if
he followed only his own individual whims: beliefs express
this life in representations; rites organize it and regulate its
working.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>At the beginning of this work we announced that the religion
whose study we were taking up contained within it the
most characteristic elements of the religious life. The exactness
of this proposition may now be verified. Howsoever simple
the system which we have studied may be, we have found within
it all the great ideas and the principal ritual attitudes which are
at the basis of even the most advanced religions: the division
of things into sacred and profane, the notions of the soul, of
spirits, of mythical personalities, and of a national and even
international divinity, a negative cult with ascetic practices
which are its exaggerated form, rites of oblation and communion,
imitative rites, commemorative rites and expiatory rites;
nothing essential is lacking. We are thus in a position to hope
that the results at which we have arrived are not peculiar to
totemism alone, but can aid us in an understanding of what
religion in general is.</p>

<p>It may be objected that one single religion, whatever its
field of extension may be, is too narrow a base for such an induction.
We have not dreamed for a moment of ignoring the
fact that an extended verification may add to the authority
of a theory, but it is equally true that when a law has been proven
by one well-made experiment, this proof is valid universally.
If in one single case a scientist succeeded in finding out the
secret of the life of even the most protoplasmic creature that
can be imagined, the truths thus obtained would be applicable
to all living beings, even the most advanced. Then if, in our
studies of these very humble societies, we have really succeeded
in discovering some of the elements out of which the most
fundamental religious notions are made up, there is no reason
for not extending the most general results of our researches
to other religions. In fact, it is inconceivable that the same
effect may be due now to one cause, now to another, according to
the circumstances, unless the two causes are at bottom only
one. A single idea cannot express one reality here and another
one there, unless the duality is only apparent. If among certain
peoples the ideas of sacredness, the soul and God are to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
explained sociologically, it should be presumed scientifically
that, in principle, the same explanation is valid for all the peoples
among whom these same ideas are found with the same essential
characteristics. Therefore, supposing that we have not been
deceived, certain at least of our conclusions can be legitimately
generalized. The moment has come to disengage these. And an
induction of this sort, having at its foundation a clearly defined
experiment, is less adventurous than many summary generalizations
which, while attempting to reach the essence of religion
at once, without resting upon the careful analysis of any religion
in particular, greatly risk losing themselves in space.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The theorists who have undertaken to explain religion in
rational terms have generally seen in it before all else a system of
ideas, corresponding to some determined object. This object has
been conceived in a multitude of ways: nature, the infinite, the
unknowable, the ideal, etc.; but these differences matter but
little. In any case, it was the conceptions and beliefs which
were considered as the essential elements of religion. As for
the rites, from this point of view they appear to be only an
external translation, contingent and material, of these internal
states which alone pass as having any intrinsic value. This
conception is so commonly held that generally the disputes of
which religion is the theme turn about the question whether it
can conciliate itself with science or not, that is to say, whether
or not there is a place beside our scientific knowledge for another
form of thought which would be specifically religious.</p>

<p>But the believers, the men who lead the religious life and have
a direct sensation of what it really is, object to this way of
regarding it, saying that it does not correspond to their daily
experience. In fact, they feel that the real function of religion
is not to make us think, to enrich our knowledge, nor to add to
the conceptions which we owe to science others of another origin
and another character, but rather, it is to make us act, to aid us
to live. The believer who has communicated with his god is
not merely a man who sees new truths of which the unbeliever
is ignorant; he is a man who is <i>stronger</i>. He feels within him
more force, either to endure the trials of existence, or to conquer
them. It is as though he were raised above the miseries of the
world, because he is raised above his condition as a mere man;
he believes that he is saved from evil, under whatever form
he may conceive this evil. The first article in every creed is the
belief in salvation by faith. But it is hard to see how a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
idea could have this efficacy. An idea is in reality only a part
of ourselves; then how could it confer upon us powers superior
to those which we have of our own nature? Howsoever rich it
might be in affective virtues, it could add nothing to our natural
vitality; for it could only release the motive powers which are
within us, neither creating them nor increasing them. From
the mere fact that we consider an object worthy of being loved
and sought after, it does not follow that we feel ourselves stronger
afterwards; it is also necessary that this object set free energies
superior to these which we ordinarily have at our command and
also that we have some means of making these enter into us
and unite themselves to our interior lives. Now for that, it is
not enough that we think of them; it is also indispensable that
we place ourselves within their sphere of action, and that we
set ourselves where we may best feel their influence; in a word,
it is necessary that we act, and that we repeat the acts thus
necessary every time we feel the need of renewing their effects.
From this point of view, it is readily seen how that group of
regularly repeated acts which form the cult get their importance.
In fact, whoever has really practised a religion knows very well
that it is the cult which gives rise to these impressions of joy,
of interior peace, of serenity, of enthusiasm which are, for the
believer, an experimental proof of his beliefs. The cult is not
simply a system of signs by which the faith is outwardly translated;
it is a collection of the means by which this is created
and recreated periodically. Whether it consists in material acts
or mental operations, it is always this which is efficacious.</p>

<p>Our entire study rests upon this postulate that the unanimous
sentiment of the believers of all times cannot be purely illusory.
Together with a recent apologist of the faith<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> we admit that
these religious beliefs rest upon a specific experience whose
demonstrative value is, in one sense, not one bit inferior to that
of scientific experiments, though different from them. We, too,
think that "a tree is known by its fruits,"<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> and that fertility
is the best proof of what the roots are worth. But from the fact
that a "religious experience," if we choose to call it this, does
exist and that it has a certain foundation&mdash;and, by the way,
is there any experience which has none?&mdash;it does not follow
that the reality which is its foundation conforms objectively
to the idea which believers have of it. The very fact that the
fashion in which it has been conceived has varied infinitely
in different times is enough to prove that none of these conceptions
express it adequately. If a scientist states it as an axiom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
that the sensations of heat and light which we feel correspond
to some objective cause, he does not conclude that this is what
it appears to the senses to be. Likewise, even if the impressions
which the faithful feel are not imaginary, still they are in no way
privileged intuitions; there is no reason for believing that they
inform us better upon the nature of their object than do ordinary
sensations upon the nature of bodies and their properties. In
order to discover what this object consists of, we must submit
them to an examination and elaboration analogous to that
which has substituted for the sensuous idea of the world another
which is scientific and conceptual.</p>

<p>This is precisely what we have tried to do, and we have seen
that this reality, which mythologies have represented under
so many different forms, but which is the universal and eternal
objective cause of these sensations <i>sui generis</i> out of which
religious experience is made, is society. We have shown what
moral forces it develops and how it awakens this sentiment of
a refuge, of a shield and of a guardian support which attaches
the believer to his cult. It is that which raises him outside
himself; it is even that which made him. For that which makes
a man is the totality of the intellectual property which constitutes
civilization, and civilization is the work of society. Thus is
explained the preponderating r&ocirc;le of the cult in all religions,
whichever they may be. This is because society cannot make
its influence felt unless it is in action, and it is not in action unless
the individuals who compose it are assembled together and act
in common. It is by common action that it takes consciousness
of itself and realizes its position; it is before all else an active
co-operation. The collective ideas and sentiments are even
possible only owing to these exterior movements which symbolize
them, as we have established.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> Then it is action which dominates
the religious life, because of the mere fact that it is society which
is its source.</p>

<p>In addition to all the reasons which have been given to justify
this conception, a final one may be added here, which is the
result of our whole work. As we have progressed, we have
established the fact that the fundamental categories of thought,
and consequently of science, are of religious origin. We have
seen that the same is true for magic and consequently for the
different processes which have issued from it. On the other hand,
it has long been known that up until a relatively advanced
moment of evolution, moral and legal rules have been indistinguishable
from ritual prescriptions. In summing up, then,
it may be said that nearly all the great social institutions have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
been born in religion.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> Now in order that these principal aspects
of the collective life may have commenced by being only varied
aspects of the religious life, it is obviously necessary that the
religious life be the eminent form and, as it were, the concentrated
expression of the whole collective life. If religion has given
birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of
society is the soul of religion.</p>

<p>Religious forces are therefore human forces, moral forces.
It is true that since collective sentiments can become conscious
of themselves only by fixing themselves upon external objects,
they have not been able to take form without adopting some
of their characteristics from other things: they have thus
acquired a sort of physical nature; in this way they have come
to mix themselves with the life of the material world, and then
have considered themselves capable of explaining what passes
there. But when they are considered only from this point of
view and in this r&ocirc;le, only their most superficial aspect is seen.
In reality, the essential elements of which these collective sentiments
are made have been borrowed by the understanding. It
ordinarily seems that they should have a human character only
when they are conceived under human forms;<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> but even the
most impersonal and the most anonymous are nothing else than
objectified sentiments.</p>

<p>It is only by regarding religion from this angle that it is possible
to see its real significance. If we stick closely to appearances,
rites often give the effect of purely manual operations: they
are anointings, washings, meals. To consecrate something, it is
put in contact with a source of religious energy, just as to-day
a body is put in contact with a source of heat or electricity to
warm or electrize it; the two processes employed are not
essentially different. Thus understood, religious technique seems
to be a sort of mystic mechanics. But these material man&#339;uvres
are only the external envelope under which the mental operations
are hidden. Finally, there is no question of exercising
a physical constraint upon blind and, incidentally, imaginary
forces, but rather of reaching individual consciousnesses, of giving
them a direction and of disciplining them. It is sometimes said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
that inferior religions are materialistic. Such an expression is inexact.
All religions, even the crudest, are in a sense spiritualistic:
for the powers they put in play are before all spiritual, and also
their principal object is to act upon the moral life. Thus it is
seen that whatever has been done in the name of religion cannot
have been done in vain: for it is necessarily the society that
did it, and it is humanity that has reaped the fruits.</p>


<p class="npara">But, it is said, what society is it that has thus made the
basis of religion? Is it the real society, such as it is and acts
before our very eyes, with the legal and moral organization
which it has laboriously fashioned during the course of history?
This is full of defects and imperfections. In it, evil goes beside
the good, injustice often reigns supreme, and the truth is often
obscured by error. How could anything so crudely organized
inspire the sentiments of love, the ardent enthusiasm and the
spirit of abnegation which all religions claim of their followers?
These perfect beings which are gods could not have taken their
traits from so mediocre, and sometimes even so base a reality.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, does someone think of a perfect society,
where justice and truth would be sovereign, and from which evil
in all its forms would be banished for ever? No one would
deny that this is in close relations with the religious sentiment;
for, they would say, it is towards the realization of this that all
religions strive. But that society is not an empirical fact, definite
and observable; it is a fancy, a dream with which men have
lightened their sufferings, but in which they have never really
lived. It is merely an idea which comes to express our more or
less obscure aspirations towards the good, the beautiful and the
ideal. Now these aspirations have their roots in us; they come
from the very depths of our being; then there is nothing outside
of us which can account for them. Moreover, they are already
religious in themselves; thus it would seem that the ideal
society presupposes religion, far from being able to explain it.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>But, in the first place, things are arbitrarily simplified when
religion is seen only on its idealistic side: in its way, it is realistic.
There is no physical or moral ugliness, there are no vices or evils
which do not have a special divinity. There are gods of theft
and trickery, of lust and war, of sickness and of death. Christianity
itself, howsoever high the idea which it has made of the
divinity may be, has been obliged to give the spirit of evil a
place in its mythology. Satan is an essential piece of the Christian
system; even if he is an impure being, he is not a profane one.
The anti-god, is a god, inferior and subordinated, it is true, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
nevertheless endowed with extended powers; he is even the
object of rites, at least of negative ones. Thus religion, far
from ignoring the real society and making abstraction of it,
is in its image; it reflects all its aspects, even the most vulgar
and the most repulsive. All is to be found there, and if in the
majority of cases we see the good victorious over evil, life over
death, the powers of light over the powers of darkness, it is
because reality is not otherwise. If the relation between these
two contrary forces were reversed, life would be impossible;
but, as a matter of fact, it maintains itself and even tends to
develop.</p>

<p>But if, in the midst of these mythologies and theologies we
see reality clearly appearing, it is none the less true that it is
found there only in an enlarged, transformed and idealized
form. In this respect, the most primitive religions do not differ
from the most recent and the most refined. For example, we
have seen how the Arunta place at the beginning of time a
mythical society whose organization exactly reproduces that
which still exists to-day; it includes the same clans and phratries,
it is under the same matrimonial rules and it practises the same
rites. But the personages who compose it are ideal beings,
gifted with powers and virtues to which common mortals cannot
pretend. Their nature is not only higher, but it is different,
since it is at once animal and human. The evil powers there
undergo a similar metamorphosis: evil itself is, as it were,
made sublime and idealized. The question now raises itself of
whence this idealization comes.</p>

<p>Some reply that men have a natural faculty for idealizing,
that is to say, of substituting for the real world another different
one, to which they transport themselves by thought. But that is
merely changing the terms of the problem; it is not resolving
it or even advancing it. This systematic idealization is an
essential characteristic of religions. Explaining them by an
innate power of idealization is simply replacing one word by
another which is the equivalent of the first; it is as if they said
that men have made religions because they have a religious
nature. Animals know only one world, the one which they
perceive by experience, internal as well as external. Men alone
have the faculty of conceiving the ideal, of adding something
to the real. Now where does this singular privilege come from?
Before making it an initial fact or a mysterious virtue which
escapes science, we must be sure that it does not depend upon
empirically determinable conditions.</p>

<p>The explanation of religion which we have proposed has
precisely this advantage, that it gives an answer to this question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
For our definition of the sacred is that it is something added to
and above the real: now the ideal answers to this same definition;
we cannot explain one without explaining the other. In fact,
we have seen that if collective life awakens religious thought
on reaching a certain degree of intensity, it is because it brings
about a state of effervescence which changes the conditions of
psychic activity. Vital energies are over-excited, passions
more active, sensations stronger; there are even some which
are produced only at this moment. A man does not recognize
himself; he feels himself transformed and consequently he
transforms the environment which surrounds him. In order
to account for the very particular impressions which he receives,
he attributes to the things with which he is in most direct contact
properties which they have not, exceptional powers and virtues
which the objects of every-day experience do not possess. In
a word, above the real world where his profane life passes he has
placed another which, in one sense, does not exist except in
thought, but to which he attributes a higher sort of dignity
than to the first. Thus, from a double point of view it is an
ideal world.</p>

<p>The formation of the ideal world is therefore not an irreducible
fact which escapes science; it depends upon conditions which
observation can touch; it is a natural product of social life.
For a society to become conscious of itself and maintain at
the necessary degree of intensity the sentiments which it thus
attains, it must assemble and concentrate itself. Now this
concentration brings about an exaltation of the mental life which
takes form in a group of ideal conceptions where is portrayed
the new life thus awakened; they correspond to this new set of
psychical forces which is added to those which we have at our
disposition for the daily tasks of existence. A society can neither
create itself nor recreate itself without at the same time creating
an ideal. This creation is not a sort of work of supererogation
for it, by which it would complete itself, being already formed;
it is the act by which it is periodically made and remade. Therefore
when some oppose the ideal society to the real society,
like two antagonists which would lead us in opposite directions,
they materialize and oppose abstractions. The ideal society
is not outside of the real society; it is a part of it. Far from
being divided between them as between two poles which mutually
repel each other, we cannot hold to one without holding to the
other. For a society is not made up merely of the mass of individuals
who compose it, the ground which they occupy, the
things which they use and the movements which they perform,
but above all is the idea which it forms of itself. It is un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>doubtedly
true that it hesitates over the manner in which it ought
to conceive itself; it feels itself drawn in divergent directions.
But these conflicts which break forth are not between the ideal
and reality, but between two different ideals, that of yesterday
and that of to-day, that which has the authority of tradition
and that which has the hope of the future. There is surely a
place for investigating whence these ideals evolve; but whatever
solution may be given to this problem, it still remains
that all passes in the world of the ideal.</p>

<p>Thus the collective ideal which religion expresses is far from
being due to a vague innate power of the individual, but it is
rather at the school of collective life that the individual has
learned to idealize. It is in assimilating the ideals elaborated
by society that he has become capable of conceiving the ideal.
It is society which, by leading him within its sphere of action,
has made him acquire the need of raising himself above the
world of experience and has at the same time furnished him
with the means of conceiving another. For society has constructed
this new world in constructing itself, since it is society
which this expresses. Thus both with the individual and in
the group, the faculty of idealizing has nothing mysterious about
it. It is not a sort of luxury which a man could get along without,
but a condition of his very existence. He could not be a social
being, that is to say, he could not be a man, if he had not acquired
it. It is true that in incarnating themselves in individuals,
collective ideals tend to individualize themselves. Each understands
them after his own fashion and marks them with his own
stamp; he suppresses certain elements and adds others. Thus
the personal ideal disengages itself from the social ideal in proportion
as the individual personality develops itself and becomes
an autonomous source of action. But if we wish to understand
this aptitude, so singular in appearance, of living outside of
reality, it is enough to connect it with the social conditions upon
which it depends.</p>

<p>Therefore it is necessary to avoid seeing in this theory of
religion a simple restatement of historical materialism: that
would be misunderstanding our thought to an extreme degree.
In showing that religion is something essentially social, we do
not mean to say that it confines itself to translating into another
language the material forms of society and its immediate vital
necessities. It is true that we take it as evident that social
life depends upon its material foundation and bears its mark,
just as the mental life of an individual depends upon his
nervous system and in fact his whole organism. But collective
consciousness is something more than a mere epiphenomenon of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
morphological basis, just as individual consciousness is something
more than a simple efflorescence of the nervous system. In order
that the former may appear, a synthesis <i>sui generis</i> of particular
consciousnesses is required. Now this synthesis has the effect
of disengaging a whole world of sentiments, ideas and images
which, once born, obey laws all their own. They attract each
other, repel each other, unite, divide themselves, and multiply,
though these combinations are not commanded and necessitated
by the condition of the underlying reality. The life thus brought
into being even enjoys so great an independence that it sometimes
indulges in manifestations with no purpose or utility of
any sort, for the mere pleasure of affirming itself. We have
shown that this is often precisely the case with ritual activity
and mythological thought.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>


<p class="npara">But if religion is the product of social causes, how can we
explain the individual cult and the universalistic character of
certain religions? If it is born <i>in foro externo</i>, how has it been
able to pass into the inner conscience of the individual and penetrate
there ever more and more profoundly? If it is the work
of definite and individualized societies, how has it been able to
detach itself from them, even to the point of being conceived as
something common to all humanity?</p>

<p>In the course of our studies, we have met with the germs of
individual religion and of religious cosmopolitanism, and we
have seen how they were formed; thus we possess the more
general elements of the reply which is to be given to this double
question.</p>

<p>We have shown how the religious force which animates the
clan particularizes itself, by incarnating itself in particular
consciousnesses. Thus secondary sacred beings are formed;
each individual has his own, made in his own image, associated
to his own intimate life, bound up with his own destiny; it is
the soul, the individual totem, the protecting ancestor, etc.
These beings are the object of rites which the individual can
celebrate by himself, outside of any group; this is the first
form of the individual cult. To be sure, it is only a very rudimentary
cult; but since the personality of the individual is
still only slightly marked, and but little value is attributed to
it, the cult which expresses it could hardly be expected to be
very highly developed as yet. But as individuals have differentiated
themselves more and more and the value of an individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
has increased, the corresponding cult has taken a relatively
greater place in the totality of the religious life and at the same
time it is more fully closed to outside influences.</p>

<p>Thus the existence of individual cults implies nothing which
contradicts or embarrasses the sociological interpretation of
religion; for the religious forces to which it addresses itself
are only the individualized forms of collective forces. Therefore,
even when religion seems to be entirely within the individual
conscience, it is still in society that it finds the living source
from which it is nourished. We are now able to appreciate
the value of the radical individualism which would make religion
something purely individual: it misunderstands the fundamental
conditions of the religious life. If up to the present it has remained
in the stage of theoretical aspirations which have never
been realized, it is because it is unrealizable. A philosophy
may well be elaborated in the silence of the interior imagination,
but not so a faith. For before all else, a faith is warmth, life,
enthusiasm, the exaltation of the whole mental life, the raising
of the individual above himself. Now how could he add to the
energies which he possesses without going outside himself?
How could he surpass himself merely by his own forces? The
only source of life at which we can morally reanimate ourselves
is that formed by the society of our fellow beings; the
only moral forces with which we can sustain and increase our
own are those which we get from others. Let us even admit
that there really are beings more or less analogous to those
which the mythologies represent. In order that they may exercise
over souls the useful direction which is their reason for existence,
it is necessary that men believe in them. Now these beliefs
are active only when they are partaken by many. A man cannot
retain them any length of time by a purely personal effort;
it is not thus that they are born or that they are acquired; it
is even doubtful if they can be kept under these conditions.
In fact, a man who has a veritable faith feels an invincible need
of spreading it: therefore he leaves his isolation, approaches
others and seeks to convince them, and it is the ardour of the
convictions which he arouses that strengthens his own. It
would quickly weaken if it remained alone.</p>

<p>It is the same with religious universalism as with this
individualism. Far from being an exclusive attribute of certain
very great religions, we have found it, not at the base, it is true,
but at the summit of the Australian system. Bunjil, Daramulun
or Baiame are not simple tribal gods; each of them is recognized
by a number of different tribes. In a sense, their cult is international.
This conception is therefore very near to that found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
in the most recent theologies. So certain writers have felt it
their duty to deny its authenticity, howsoever incontestable
this may be.</p>

<p>And we have been able to show how this has been formed.</p>

<p>Neighbouring tribes of a similar civilization cannot fail to
be in constant relations with each other. All sorts of circumstances
give an occasion for it: besides commerce, which is
still rudimentary, there are marriages; these international
marriages are very common in Australia. In the course of
these meetings, men naturally become conscious of the moral
relationship which united them. They have the same social
organization, the same division into phratries, clans and matrimonial
classes; they practise the same rites of initiation, or
wholly similar ones. Mutual loans and treaties result in reinforcing
these spontaneous resemblances. The gods to which
these manifestly identical institutions were attached could
hardly have remained distinct in their minds. Everything
tended to bring them together and consequently, even supposing
that each tribe elaborated the notion independently, they must
necessarily have tended to confound themselves with each other.
Also, it is probable that it was in inter-tribal assemblies that
they were first conceived. For they are chiefly the gods of
initiation, and in the initiation ceremonies, the different tribes
are usually represented. So if sacred beings are formed
which are connected with no geographically determined society,
that is not because they have an extra-social origin. It is
because there are other groups above these geographically
determined ones, whose contours are less clearly marked: they
have no fixed frontiers, but include all sorts of more or less
neighbouring and related tribes. The particular social life
thus created tends to spread itself over an area with no definite
limits. Naturally the mythological personages who correspond
to it have the same character; their sphere of influence is not
limited; they go beyond the particular tribes and their territory.
They are the great international gods.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing in this situation which is peculiar to
Australian societies. There is no people and no state which is
not a part of another society, more or less unlimited, which
embraces all the peoples and all the States with which the first
comes in contact, either directly or indirectly; there is no
national life which is not dominated by a collective life of an
international nature. In proportion as we advance in history,
these international groups acquire a greater importance and
extent. Thus we see how, in certain cases, this universalistic
tendency has been able to develop itself to the point of affecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
not only the higher ideas of the religious system, but even the
principles upon which it rests.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined
to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought
has successively enveloped itself. There can be no society which
does not feel the need of upholding and reaffirming at regular
intervals the collective sentiments and the collective ideas which
make its unity and its personality. Now this moral remaking
cannot be achieved except by the means of reunions, assemblies
and meetings where the individuals, being closely united to one
another, reaffirm in common their common sentiments; hence
come ceremonies which do not differ from regular religious ceremonies,
either in their object, the results which they produce, or
the processes employed to attain these results. What essential
difference is there between an assembly of Christians celebrating
the principal dates of the life of Christ, or of Jews remembering
the exodus from Egypt or the promulgation of the decalogue,
and a reunion of citizens commemorating the promulgation of a
new moral or legal system or some great event in the national
life?</p>

<p>If we find a little difficulty to-day in imagining what these
feasts and ceremonies of the future could consist in, it is because
we are going through a stage of transition and moral mediocrity.
The great things of the past which filled our fathers with
enthusiasm do not excite the same ardour in us, either because
they have come into common usage to such an extent that we
are unconscious of them, or else because they no longer answer
to our actual aspirations; but as yet there is nothing to replace
them. We can no longer impassionate ourselves for the principles
in the name of which Christianity recommended to masters
that they treat their slaves humanely, and, on the other hand,
the idea which it has formed of human equality and fraternity
seems to us to-day to leave too large a place for unjust inequalities.
Its pity for the outcast seems to us too Platonic; we desire
another which would be more practicable; but as yet we cannot
clearly see what it should be nor how it could be realized in
facts. In a word, the old gods are growing old or already dead,
and others are not yet born. This is what rendered vain the
attempt of Comte with the old historic souvenirs artificially
revived; it is life itself, and not a dead past which can produce
a living cult. But this state of incertitude and confused agitation
cannot last for ever. A day will come when our societies will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
know again those hours of creative effervescence, in the course
of which new ideas arise and new formul&aelig; are found which serve
for a while as a guide to humanity; and when these hours shall
have been passed through once, men will spontaneously feel
the need of reliving them from time to time in thought, that is
to say, of keeping alive their memory by means of celebrations
which regularly reproduce their fruits. We have already seen
how the French Revolution established a whole cycle of holidays
to keep the principles with which it was inspired in a state of
perpetual youth. If this institution quickly fell away, it was
because the revolutionary faith lasted but a moment, and deceptions
and discouragements rapidly succeeded the first
moments of enthusiasm. But though the work may have miscarried,
it enables us to imagine what might have happened in
other conditions; and everything leads us to believe that it
will be taken up again sooner or later. There are no gospels
which are immortal, but neither is there any reason for believing
that humanity is incapable of inventing new ones. As to the
question of what symbols this new faith will express itself with,
whether they will resemble those of the past or not, and whether
or not they will be more adequate for the reality which they
seek to translate, that is something which surpasses the human
faculty of foresight and which does not appertain to the principal
question.</p>

<p>But feasts and rites, in a word, the cult, are not the whole
religion. This is not merely a system of practices, but also a
system of ideas whose object is to explain the world; we have
seen that even the humblest have their cosmology. Whatever
connection there may be between these two elements of the
religious life, they are still quite different. The one is turned
towards action, which it demands and regulates; the other is
turned towards thought, which it enriches and organizes. Then
they do not depend upon the same conditions, and consequently
it may be asked if the second answers to necessities as universal
and as permanent as the first.</p>

<p>When specific characteristics are attributed to religious thought,
and when it is believed that its function is to express, by means
peculiar to itself, an aspect of reality which evades ordinary
knowledge as well as science, one naturally refuses to admit that
religion can ever abandon its speculative r&ocirc;le. But our analysis
of the facts does not seem to have shown this specific quality
of religion. The religion which we have just studied is one of
those whose symbols are the most disconcerting for the reason.
There all appears mysterious. These beings which belong to the
most heterogeneous groups at the same time, who multiply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
without ceasing to be one, who divide without diminishing,
all seem, at first view, to belong to an entirely different world
from the one where we live; some have even gone so far as to
say that the mind which constructed them ignored the laws of
logic completely. Perhaps the contrast between reason and
faith has never been more thorough. Then if there has ever
been a moment in history when their heterogeneousness should
have stood out clearly, it is here. But contrary to all appearances,
as we have pointed out, the realities to which religious
speculation is then applied are the same as those which later
serve as the subject of reflection for philosophers: they are
nature, man, society. The mystery which appears to surround
them is wholly superficial and disappears before a more painstaking
observation: it is enough merely to set aside the veil
with which mythological imagination has covered them for them
to appear such as they really are. Religion sets itself to translate
these realities into an intelligible language which does not differ
in nature from that employed by science; the attempt is made
by both to connect things with each other, to establish internal
relations between them, to classify them and to systematize them.
We have even seen that the essential ideas of scientific logic are of
religious origin. It is true that in order to utilize them, science
gives them a new elaboration; it purges them of all accidental
elements; in a general way, it brings a spirit of criticism into
all its doings, which religion ignores; it surrounds itself with
precautions to "escape precipitation and bias," and to hold
aside the passions, prejudices and all subjective influences.
But these perfectionings of method are not enough to differentiate
it from religion. In this regard, both pursue the same end;
scientific thought is only a more perfect form of religious thought.
Thus it seems natural that the second should progressively
retire before the first, as this becomes better fitted to perform
the task.</p>

<p>And there is no doubt that this regression has taken place
in the course of history. Having left religion, science tends to
substitute itself for this latter in all that which concerns the
cognitive and intellectual functions. Christianity has already
definitely consecrated this substitution in the order of material
things. Seeing in matter that which is profane before all else,
it readily left the knowledge of this to another discipline, <i>tradidit
mundum hominum disputationi</i>, "He gave the world over to the
disputes of men"; it is thus that the natural sciences have been
able to establish themselves and make their authority recognized
without very great difficulty. But it could not give up the world
of souls so easily; for it is before all over souls that the god of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the Christians aspires to reign. That is why the idea of submitting
the psychic life to science produced the effect of a sort
of profanation for a long time; even to-day it is repugnant
to many minds. However, experimental and comparative
psychology is founded and to-day we must reckon with it. But
the world of the religious and moral life is still forbidden. The
great majority of men continue to believe that here there is an
order of things which the mind cannot penetrate except by
very special ways. Hence comes the active resistance which
is met with every time that someone tries to treat religious
and moral phenomena scientifically. But in spite of these
oppositions, these attempts are constantly repeated and this
persistence even allows us to foresee that this final barrier will
finally give way and that science will establish herself as mistress
even in this reserved region.</p>

<p>That is what the conflict between science and religion really
amounts to. It is said that science denies religion in principle.
But religion exists; it is a system of given facts; in a word, it
is a reality. How could science deny this reality? Also, in so
far as religion is action, and in so far as it is a means of making
men live, science could not take its place, for even if this expresses
life, it does not create it; it may well seek to explain the faith,
but by that very act it presupposes it. Thus there is no conflict
except upon one limited point. Of the two functions which
religion originally fulfilled, there is one, and only one, which
tends to escape it more and more: that is its speculative function.
That which science refuses to grant to religion is not its right to
exist, but its right to dogmatize upon the nature of things and
the special competence which it claims for itself for knowing
man and the world. As a matter of fact, it does not know itself.
It does not even know what it is made of, nor to what need it
answers. It is itself a subject for science, so far is it from being
able to make the law for science! And from another point of
view, since there is no proper subject for religious speculation
outside that reality to which scientific reflection is applied, it is
evident that this former cannot play the same r&ocirc;le in the future
that it has played in the past.</p>

<p>However, it seems destined to transform itself rather than to
disappear.</p>

<p>We have said that there is something eternal in religion:
it is the cult and the faith. Men cannot celebrate ceremonies for
which they see no reason, nor can they accept a faith which
they in no way understand. To spread itself or merely to maintain
itself, it must be justified, that is to say, a theory must be
made of it. A theory of this sort must undoubtedly be founded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
upon the different sciences, from the moment when these exist;
first of all, upon the social sciences, for religious faith has its
origin in society; then upon psychology, for society is a synthesis
of human consciousnesses; and finally upon the sciences of
nature, for man and society are a part of the universe and can
be abstracted from it only artificially. But howsoever important
these facts taken from the constituted sciences may be, they
are not enough; for faith is before all else an impetus to action,
while science, no matter how far it may be pushed, always
remains at a distance from this. Science is fragmentary and
incomplete; it advances but slowly and is never finished; but
life cannot wait. The theories which are destined to make men
live and act are therefore obliged to pass science and complete
it prematurely. They are possible only when the practical
exigencies and the vital necessities which we feel without distinctly
conceiving them push thought in advance, beyond that which
science permits us to affirm. Thus religions, even the most
rational and laicized, cannot and never will be able to dispense
with a particular form of speculation which, though having
the same subjects as science itself, cannot be really scientific:
the obscure intuitions of sensation and sentiment too often
take the place of logical reasons. On one side, this speculation
resembles that which we meet with in the religions of the past;
but on another, it is different. While claiming and exercising
the right of going beyond science, it must commence by knowing
this and by inspiring itself with it. Ever since the authority
of science was established, it must be reckoned with; one can
go farther than it under the pressure of necessity, but he must
take his direction from it. He can affirm nothing that it denies,
deny nothing that it affirms, and establish nothing that is not
directly or indirectly founded upon principles taken from it.
From now on, the faith no longer exercises the same hegemony
as formerly over the system of ideas that we may continue to
call religion. A rival power rises up before it which, being born
of it, ever after submits it to its criticism and control. And
everything makes us foresee that this control will constantly
become more extended and efficient, while no limit can be assigned
to its future influence.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>But if the fundamental notions of science are of a religious
origin, how has religion been able to bring them forth? At first
sight, one does not see what relations there can be between
religion and logic. Or, since the reality which religious thought
expresses is society, the question can be stated in the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
terms, which make the entire difficulty appear even better:
what has been able to make social life so important a source
for the logical life? It seems as though nothing could have
predestined it to this r&ocirc;le, for it certainly was not to satisfy
their speculative needs that men associated themselves together.</p>

<p>Perhaps we shall be found over bold in attempting so complex
a question here. To treat it as it should be treated, the
sociological conditions of knowledge should be known much
better than they actually are; we are only beginning to catch
glimpses of some of them. However, the question is so grave,
and so directly implied in all that has preceded, that we must
make an effort not to leave it without an answer. Perhaps it is
not impossible, even at present, to state some general principles
which may at least aid in the solution.</p>

<p>Logical thought is made up of concepts. Seeking how society
can have played a r&ocirc;le in the genesis of logical thought thus
reduces itself to seeking how it can have taken a part in the
formation of concepts.</p>

<p>If, as is ordinarily the case, we see in the concept only a general
idea, the problem appears insoluble. By his own power, the individual
can compare his conceptions and images, disengage that
which they have in common, and thus, in a word, generalize. Then
it is hard to see why this generalization should be possible only
in and through society. But, in the first place, it is inadmissible
that logical thought is characterized only by the greater extension
of the conceptions of which it is made up. If particular ideas
have nothing logical about them, why should it be different
with general ones? The general exists only in the particular;
it is the particular simplified and impoverished. Then the first
could have no virtues or privileges which the second has not.
Inversely, if conceptual thought can be applied to the class,
species or variety, howsoever restricted these may be, why can
it not be extended to the individual, that is to say, to the limit
towards which the conception tends, proportionately as its
extension diminishes? As a matter of fact, there are many
concepts which have only individuals as their object. In every
sort of religion, gods are individualities distinct from each other;
however, they are conceived, not perceived. Each people represents
its historic or legendary heroes in fashions which vary with
the time. Finally, every one of us forms an idea of the individuals
with whom he comes in contact, of their character, of their
appearance, their distinctive traits and their moral and physical
temperaments: these notions, too, are real concepts. It is true
that in general they are formed crudely enough; but even among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
scientific concepts, are there a great many that are perfectly
adequate for their object? In this direction, there are only
differences of degree between them.</p>

<p>Therefore the concept must be defined by other characteristics.
It is opposed to sensual representations of every order&mdash;sensations,
perceptions or images&mdash;by the following properties.</p>

<p>Sensual representations are in a perpetual flux; they come
after each other like the waves of a river, and even during the
time that they last, they do not remain the same thing. Each
of them is an integral part of the precise instant when it takes
place. We are never sure of again finding a perception such as
we experienced it the first time; for if the thing perceived has
not changed, it is we who are no longer the same. On the contrary,
the concept is, as it were, outside of time and change;
it is in the depths below all this agitation; it might be said
that it is in a different portion of the mind, which is serener and
calmer. It does not move of itself, by an internal and spontaneous
evolution, but, on the contrary, it resists change. It is a manner of
thinking that, at every moment of time, is fixed and crystallized.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>
In so far as it is what it ought to be, it is immutable. If it changes,
it is not because it is its nature to do so, but because we have
discovered some imperfection in it; it is because it had to be
rectified. The system of concepts with which we think in everyday
life is that expressed by the vocabulary of our mother tongue;
for every word translates a concept. Now language is something
fixed; it changes but very slowly, and consequently it is the
same with the conceptual system which it expresses. The
scholar finds himself in the same situation in regard to the special
terminology employed by the science to which he has consecrated
himself, and hence in regard to the special scheme of concepts
to which this terminology corresponds. It is true that he can
make innovations, but these are always a sort of violence done
to the established ways of thinking.</p>

<p>And at the same time that it is relatively immutable, the
concept is universal, or at least capable of becoming so. A
concept is not my concept; I hold it in common with other
men, or, in any case, can communicate it to them. It is impossible
for me to make a sensation pass from my consciousness
into that of another; it holds closely to my organism and
personality and cannot be detached from them. All that I can
do is to invite others to place themselves before the same object
as myself and to leave themselves to its action. On the other
hand, conversation and all intellectual communication between
men is an exchange of concepts. The concept is an essentially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
impersonal representation; it is through it that human intelligences
communicate.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a></p>

<p>The nature of the concept, thus defined, bespeaks its origin.
If it is common to all, it is the work of the community. Since
it bears the mark of no particular mind, it is clear that it was
elaborated by a unique intelligence, where all others meet each
other, and after a fashion, come to nourish themselves. If it
has more stability than sensations or images, it is because the
collective representations are more stable than the individual
ones; for while an individual is conscious even of the slight
changes which take place in his environment, only events of
a greater gravity can succeed in affecting the mental status of
a society. Every time that we are in the presence of a <i>type</i><a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>
of thought or action which is imposed uniformly upon particular
wills or intelligences, this pressure exercised over the individual
betrays the intervention of the group. Also, as we have already
said, the concepts with which we ordinarily think are those
of our vocabulary. Now it is unquestionable that language,
and consequently the system of concepts which it translates,
is the product of a collective elaboration. What it expresses
is the manner in which society as a whole represents the facts
of experience. The ideas which correspond to the diverse elements
of language are thus collective representations.</p>

<p>Even their contents bear witness to the same fact. In fact,
there are scarcely any words among those which we usually
employ whose meaning does not pass, to a greater or less extent,
the limits of our personal experience. Very frequently a term
expresses things which we have never perceived or experiences
which we have never had or of which we have never been the
witnesses. Even when we know some of the objects which it
concerns, it is only as particular examples that they serve to
illustrate the idea which they would never have been able to
form by themselves. Thus there is a great deal of knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
condensed in the word which I never collected, and which is
not individual; it even surpasses me to such an extent that
I cannot even completely appropriate all its results. Which
of us knows all the words of the language he speaks and the
entire signification of each?</p>

<p>This remark enables us to determine the sense in which we
mean to say that concepts are collective representations. If
they belong to a whole social group, it is not because they represent
the average of the corresponding individual representations;
for in that case they would be poorer than the latter in intellectual
content, while, as a matter of fact, they contain much that surpasses
the knowledge of the average individual. They are not
abstractions which have a reality only in particular consciousnesses,
but they are as concrete representations as an individual
could form of his own personal environment: they correspond
to the way in which this very special being, society, considers
the things of its own proper experience. If, as a matter of fact,
the concepts are nearly always general ideas, and if they express
categories and classes rather than particular objects, it is because
the unique and variable characteristics of things interest society
but rarely; because of its very extent, it can scarcely be affected
by more than their general and permanent qualities. Therefore
it is to this aspect of affairs that it gives its attention: it is a
part of its nature to see things in large and under the aspect
which they ordinarily have. But this generality is not necessary
for them, and, in any case, even when these representations
have the generic character which they ordinarily have, they
are the work of society and are enriched by its experience.</p>

<p>That is what makes conceptual thought so valuable for us.
If concepts were only general ideas, they would not enrich
knowledge a great deal, for, as we have already pointed out,
the general contains nothing more than the particular. But if
before all else they are collective representations, they add to
that which we can learn by our own personal experience all
that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in
the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely
seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a
light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and
transforms it. Conceiving something is both learning its essential
elements better and also locating it in its place; for each civilization
has its organized system of concepts which characterizes
it. Before this scheme of ideas, the individual is in the same
situation as the &#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; of Plato before the world of Ideas. He
must assimilate them to himself, for he must have them to hold
intercourse with others; but the assimilation is always imperfect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
Each of us sees them after his own fashion. There are some
which escape us completely and remain outside of our circle of
vision; there are others of which we perceive certain aspects only.
There are even a great many which we pervert in holding, for
as they are collective by nature, they cannot become individualized
without being retouched, modified, and consequently
falsified. Hence comes the great trouble we have in understanding
each other, and the fact that we even lie to each other
without wishing to: it is because we all use the same words
without giving them the same meaning.</p>

<p>We are now able to see what the part of society in the genesis
of logical thought is. This is possible only from the moment
when, above the fugitive conceptions which they owe to sensuous
experience, men have succeeded in conceiving a whole world
of stable ideas, the common ground of all intelligences. In fact,
logical thinking is always impersonal thinking, and is also thought
<i>sub species &aelig;trnitatis</i>&mdash;as though for all time. Impersonality
and stability are the two characteristics of truth. Now logical
life evidently presupposes that men know, at least confusedly,
that there is such a thing as truth, distinct from sensuous appearances.
But how have they been able to arrive at this conception?
We generally talk as though it should have spontaneously
presented itself to them from the moment they opened their
eyes upon the world. However, there is nothing in immediate
experience which could suggest it; everything even contradicts
it. Thus the child and the animal have no suspicion of it. History
shows that it has taken centuries for it to disengage and
establish itself. In our Western world, it was with the great
thinkers of Greece that it first became clearly conscious of itself
and of the consequences which it implies; when the discovery
was made, it caused an amazement which Plato has translated
into magnificent language. But if it is only at this epoch that
the idea is expressed in philosophic formul&aelig;, it was necessarily
pre-existent in the stage of an obscure sentiment. Philosophers
have sought to elucidate this sentiment, but they have not
succeeded. In order that they might reflect upon it and analyse
it, it was necessary that it be given them, and that they seek to
know whence it came, that is to say, in what experience it was
founded. This is in collective experience. It is under the form
of collective thought that impersonal thought is for the first
time revealed to humanity; we cannot see by what other way
this revelation could have been made. From the mere fact
that society exists, there is also, outside of the individual sensations
and images, a whole system of representations which enjoy
marvellous properties. By means of them, men understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
each other and intelligences grasp each other. They have within
them a sort of force or moral ascendancy, in virtue of which
they impose themselves upon individual minds. Hence the
individual at least obscurely takes account of the fact that
above his private ideas, there is a world of absolute ideas according
to which he must shape his own; he catches a glimpse of a
whole intellectual kingdom in which he participates, but which
is greater than he. This is the first intuition of the realm of
truth. From the moment when he first becomes conscious of
these higher ideas, he sets himself to scrutinizing their nature;
he asks whence these pre-eminent representations hold their
prerogatives and, in so far as he believes that he has discovered
their causes, he undertakes to put these causes into action for
himself, in order that he may draw from them by his own force
the effects which they produce; that is to say, he attributes
to himself the right of making concepts. Thus the faculty of
conception has individualized itself. But to understand its
origins and function, it must be attached to the social conditions
upon which it depends.</p>

<p>It may be objected that we show the concept in one of its
aspects only, and that its unique r&ocirc;le is not the assuring
of a harmony among minds, but also, and to a greater extent,
their harmony with the nature of things. It seems as though
it had a reason for existence only on condition of being true,
that is to say, objective, and as though its impersonality were
only a consequence of its objectivity. It is in regard to things,
thought of as adequately as possible, that minds ought to
communicate. Nor do we deny that the evolution of concepts
has been partially in this direction. The concept which was
first held as true because it was collective tends to be no longer
collective except on condition of being held as true: we
demand its credentials of it before according it our confidence.
But we must not lose sight of the fact that even to-day the
great majority of the concepts which we use are not methodically
constituted; we get them from language, that is to
say, from common experience, without submitting them to
any criticism. The scientifically elaborated and criticized concepts
are always in the very slight minority. Also, between
them and those which draw all their authority from the
fact that they are collective, there are only differences of
degree. A collective representation presents guarantees of
objectivity by the fact that it is collective: for it is not without
sufficient reason that it has been able to generalize and maintain
itself with persistence. If it were out of accord with the nature
of things, it would never have been able to acquire an extended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
and prolonged empire over intellects. At bottom, the confidence
inspired by scientific concepts is due to the fact that they can
be methodically controlled. But a collective representation is
necessarily submitted to a control that is repeated indefinitely;
the men who accept it verify it by their own experience. Therefore,
it could not be wholly inadequate for its subject. It is
true that it may express this by means of imperfect symbols;
but scientific symbols themselves are never more than approximative.
It is precisely this principle which is at the basis of
the method which we follow in the study of religious phenomena:
we take it as an axiom that religious beliefs, howsoever
strange their appearance may be at times, contain a truth
which must be discovered.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not at all true that concepts, even
when constructed according to the rules of science, get their
authority uniquely from their objective value. It is not
enough that they be true to be believed. If they are not in
harmony with the other beliefs and opinions, or, in a word,
with the mass of the other collective representations, they
will be denied; minds will be closed to them; consequently it
will be as though they did not exist. To-day it is generally
sufficient that they bear the stamp of science to receive a
sort of privileged credit, because we have faith in science.
But this faith does not differ essentially from religious faith.
In the last resort, the value which we attribute to science
depends upon the idea which we collectively form of its nature
and r&ocirc;le in life; that is as much as to say that it expresses
a state of public opinion. In all social life, in fact, science rests
upon opinion. It is undoubtedly true that this opinion can
be taken as the object of a study and a science made of it;
this is what sociology principally consists in. But the science
of opinion does not make opinions; it can only observe them
and make them more conscious of themselves. It is true
that by this means it can lead them to change, but science
continues to be dependent upon opinion at the very moment
when it seems to be making its laws; for, as we have already
shown, it is from opinion that it holds the force necessary to act
upon opinion.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a></p>

<p>Saying that concepts express the manner in which society
represents things is also saying that conceptual thought is
coeval with humanity itself. We refuse to see in it the product
of a more or less retarded culture. A man who did not think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
with concepts would not be a man, for he would not be a
social being. If reduced to having only individual perceptions,
he would be indistinguishable from the beasts. If it has
been possible to sustain the contrary thesis, it is because concepts
have been defined by characteristics which are not
essential to them. They have been identified with general
ideas<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> and with clearly limited and circumscribed general
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> In these conditions it has possibly seemed as though the
inferior societies had no concepts properly so called; for
they have only rudimentary processes of generalization and
the ideas which they use are not generally very well
defined. But the greater part of our concepts are equally
indetermined; we force ourselves to define them only in
discussions or when doing careful work. We have also seen
that conceiving is not generalizing. Thinking conceptually
is not simply isolating and grouping together the common
characteristics of a certain number of objects; it is relating
the variable to the permanent, the individual to the social.
And since logical thought commences with the concept, it
follows that it has always existed; there is no period in
history when men have lived in a chronic confusion and
contradiction. To be sure, we cannot insist too much upon
the different characteristics which logic presents at different
periods in history; it develops like the societies themselves.
But howsoever real these differences may be, they should not
cause us to neglect the similarities, which are no less essential.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>We are now in a position to take up a final question which
has already been raised in our introduction<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> and which has
been taken as understood in the remainder of this work.
We have seen that at least some of the categories are social
things. The question is where they got this character.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it will be easily understood that since they are
themselves concepts, they are the work of the group. It can
even be said that there are no other concepts which present to
an equal degree the signs by which a collective representation
is recognized. In fact, their stability and impersonality are
such that they have often passed as being absolutely universal
and immutable. Also, as they express the fundamental
conditions for an agreement between minds, it seems evident
that they have been elaborated by society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>But the problem concerning them is more complex, for they
are social in another sense and, as it were in the second
degree. They not only come from society, but the things
which they express are of a social nature. Not only is it
society which has founded them, but their contents are the
different aspects of the social being: the category of
class was at first indistinct from the concept of the human
group; it is the rhythm of social life which is at the basis
of the category of time; the territory occupied by the
society furnished the material for the category of space; it
is the collective force which was the prototype of the concept
of efficient force, an essential element in the category of
causality. However, the categories are not made to be applied
only to the social realm; they reach out to all reality. Then
how is it that they have taken from society the models upon
which they have been constructed?</p>

<p>It is because they are the pre-eminent concepts, which
have a preponderating part in our knowledge. In fact, the
function of the categories is to dominate and envelop all the
other concepts: they are permanent moulds for the mental
life. Now for them to embrace such an object, they must be
founded upon a reality of equal amplitude.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the relations which they express exist in an
implicit way in individual consciousnesses. The individual
lives in time, and, as we have said, he has a certain sense
of temporal orientation. He is situated at a determined
point in space, and it has even been held, and sustained
with good reasons, that all sensations have something special
about them.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> He has a feeling of resemblances; similar
representations are brought together and the new representation
formed by their union has a sort of generic character. We
also have the sensation of a certain regularity in the order of
the succession of phenomena; even an animal is not incapable
of this. However, all these relations are strictly personal
for the individual who recognizes them, and consequently
the notion of them which he may have can in no case go beyond
his own narrow horizon. The generic images which are formed
in my consciousness by the fusion of similar images represent
only the objects which I have perceived directly; there
is nothing there which could give me the idea of a class,
that is to say, of a mould including the <i>whole</i> group of all
possible objects which satisfy the same condition. Also, it
would be necessary to have the idea of group in the first
place, and the mere observations of our interior life could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
never awaken that in us. But, above all, there is no
individual experience, howsoever extended and prolonged
it may be, which could give a suspicion of the existence of
a whole class which would embrace every single being, and
to which other classes are only co-ordinated or subordinated
species. This idea of <i>all</i>, which is at the basis of the classifications
which we have just cited, could not have come from the
individual himself, who is only a part in relation to the whole
and who never attains more than an infinitesimal fraction of
reality. And yet there is perhaps no other category of greater
importance; for as the r&ocirc;le of the categories is to envelop
all the other concepts, the category <i>par excellence</i> would
seem to be this very concept of <i>totality</i>. The theorists of
knowledge ordinarily postulate it as if it came of itself, while
it really surpasses the contents of each individual consciousness
taken alone to an infinite degree.</p>

<p>For the same reasons, the space which I know by my senses,
of which I am the centre and where everything is disposed in
relation to me, could not be space in general, which contains
all extensions and where these are co-ordinated by personal
guide-lines which are common to everybody. In the same
way, the concrete duration which I feel passing within me
and with me could not give me the idea of time in general:
the first expresses only the rhythm of my individual life;
the second should correspond to the rhythm of a life which
is not that of any individual in particular, but in which
all participate.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> In the same way, finally, the regularities
which I am able to conceive in the manner in which my sensations
succeed one another may well have a value for me; they explain
how it comes about that when I am given the first of two
phenomena whose concurrence I have observed, I tend to
expect the other. But this personal state of expectation
could not be confounded with the conception of a universal
order of succession which imposes itself upon all minds and
all events.</p>

<p>Since the world expressed by the entire system of concepts
is the one that society regards, society alone can furnish
the most general notions with which it should be represented.
Such an object can be embraced only by a subject which contains
all the individual subjects within it. Since the universe does
not exist except in so far as it is thought of, and since it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
completely thought of except by society, it takes a place
in this latter; it becomes a part of society's interior life,
while this is the totality, outside of which nothing exists.
The concept of totality is only the abstract form of the concept
of society: it is the whole which includes all things, the supreme
class which embraces all other classes. Such is the final
principle upon which repose all these primitive classifications
where beings from every realm are placed and classified in
social forms, exactly like men.<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> But if the world is inside
of society, the space which this latter occupies becomes confounded
with space in general. In fact, we have seen how each
thing has its assigned place in social space, and the degree
to which this space in general differs from the concrete expanses
which we perceive is well shown by the fact that this localization
is wholly ideal and in no way resembles what it would have
been if it had been dictated to us by sensuous experience alone.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>
For the same reason, the rhythm of collective life dominates
and embraces the varied rhythms of all the elementary lives
from which it results; consequently the time which it expresses
dominates and embraces all particular durations. It
is time in general. For a long time the history of the world
has been only another aspect of the history of society. The
one commences with the other; the periods of the first are
determined by the periods of the second. This impersonal
and total duration is measured, and the guide-lines in relation
to which it is divided and organized are fixed by the movements
of concentration or dispersion of society; or, more generally,
the periodical necessities for a collective renewal. If these
critical instants are generally attached to some material
phenomenon, such as the regular recurrence of such or such
a star or the alternation of the seasons, it is because objective
signs are necessary to make this essentially social organization
intelligible to all. In the same way, finally, the causal relation,
from the moment when it is collectively stated by the group,
becomes independent of every individual consciousness; it
rises above all particular minds and events. It is a law whose
value depends upon no person. We have already shown how
it is clearly thus that it seems to have originated.</p>

<p>Another reason explains why the constituent elements of
the categories should have been taken from social life: it is
because the relations which they express could not have been
learned except in and through society. If they are in a sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
immanent in the life of an individual, he has neither a reason
nor the means for learning them, reflecting upon them and
forming them into distinct ideas. In order to orient himself
personally in space and to know at what moments he should
satisfy his various organic needs, he has no need of making,
once and for all, a conceptual representation of time and space.
Many animals are able to find the road which leads to places
with which they are familiar; they come back at a proper
moment without knowing any of the categories; sensations
are enough to direct them automatically. They would also be
enough for men, if their sensations had to satisfy only individual
needs. To recognize the fact that one thing resembles another
which we have already experienced, it is in no way necessary
that we arrange them all in groups and species: the way in
which similar images call up each other and unite is enough
to give the feeling of resemblance. The impression that a
certain thing has already been seen or experienced implies no
classification. To recognize the things which we should seek
or from which we should flee, it would not be necessary to
attach the effects of the two to their causes by a logical bond,
if individual conveniences were the only ones in question.
Purely empirical sequences and strong connections between
the concrete representations would be as sure guides for the
will. Not only is it true that the animal has no others, but
also our own personal conduct frequently supposes nothing
more. The prudent man is the one who has a very clear sensation
of what must be done, but which he would ordinarily be quite
incapable of stating as a general law.</p>

<p>It is a different matter with society. This is possible only
when the individuals and things which compose it are divided
into certain groups, that is to say, classified, and when these
groups are classified in relation to each other. Society supposes
a self-conscious organization which is nothing other than a
classification. This organization of society naturally extends
itself to the place which this occupies. To avoid all collisions,
it is necessary that each particular group have a determined
portion of space assigned to it: in other terms, it is necessary
that space in general be divided, differentiated, arranged,
and that these divisions and arrangements be known to
everybody. On the other hand, every summons to a
celebration, a hunt or a military expedition implies fixed
and established dates, and consequently that a common time
is agreed upon, which everybody conceives in the same fashion.
Finally, the co-operation of many persons with the same end
in view is possible only when they are in agreement as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the relation which exists between this end and the means of
attaining it, that is to say, when the same causal relation is
admitted by all the co-operators in the enterprise. It is not
surprising, therefore, that social time, social space, social classes
and causality should be the basis of the corresponding categories,
since it is under their social forms that these different
relations were first grasped with a certain clarity by the human
intellect.</p>

<p>In summing up, then, we must say that society is not at
all the illogical or a-logical, incoherent and fantastic being
which it has too often been considered. Quite on the contrary,
the collective consciousness is the highest form of the
psychic life, since it is the consciousness of the consciousnesses.
Being placed outside of and above individual and local contingencies,
it sees things only in their permanent and essential
aspects, which it crystallizes into communicable ideas. At
the same time that it sees from above, it sees farther; at
every moment of time, it embraces all known reality; that
is why it alone can furnish the mind with the moulds which
are applicable to the totality of things and which make it
possible to think of them. It does not create these moulds
artificially; it finds them within itself; it does nothing but
become conscious of them. They translate the ways of
being which are found in all the stages of reality but
which appear in their full clarity only at the summit, because
the extreme complexity of the psychic life which passes there
necessitates a greater development of consciousness. Attributing
social origins to logical thought is not debasing
it or diminishing its value or reducing it to nothing more
than a system of artificial combinations; on the contrary,
it is relating it to a cause which implies it naturally. But
this is not saying that the ideas elaborated in this way are
at once adequate for their object. If society is something
universal in relation to the individual, it is none the less an
individuality itself, which has its own personal physiognomy and
its idiosyncrasies; it is a particular subject and consequently
particularizes whatever it thinks of. Therefore collective
representations also contain subjective elements, and these
must be progressively rooted out, if we are to approach reality
more closely. But howsoever crude these may have been at
the beginning, the fact remains that with them the germ of a
new mentality was given, to which the individual could never
have raised himself by his own efforts: by them the way was
opened to a stable, impersonal and organized thought which
then had nothing to do except to develop its nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>Also, the causes which have determined this development
do not seem to be specifically different from those which gave
it its initial impulse. If logical thought tends to rid itself
more and more of the subjective and personal elements which
it still retains from its origin, it is not because extra-social
factors have intervened; it is much rather because a social
life of a new sort is developing. It is this international life
which has already resulted in universalizing religious beliefs.
As it extends, the collective horizon enlarges; the society
ceases to appear as the only whole, to become a part of a much
vaster one, with indetermined frontiers, which is susceptible
of advancing indefinitely. Consequently things can no longer
be contained in the social moulds according to which they
were primitively classified; they must be organized according
to principles which are their own, so logical organization
differentiates itself from the social organization and becomes
autonomous. Really and truly human thought is not a
primitive fact; it is the product of history; it is the ideal
limit towards which we are constantly approaching, but which
in all probability we shall never succeed in reaching.</p>

<p>Thus it is not at all true that between science on the one
hand, and morals and religion on the other, there exists that
sort of antinomy which has so frequently been admitted,
for the two forms of human activity really come from one
and the same source. Kant understood this very well, and
therefore he made the speculative reason and the practical
reason two different aspects of the same faculty. According
to him, what makes their unity is the fact that the two are
directed towards the universal. Rational thinking is thinking
according to the laws which are imposed upon all reasonable
beings; acting morally is conducting one's self according to
those maxims which can be extended without contradiction to
all wills. In other words, science and morals imply that the
individual is capable of raising himself above his own peculiar
point of view and of living an impersonal life. In fact, it cannot
be doubted that this is a trait common to all the higher forms
of thought and action. What Kant's system does not explain,
however, is the origin of this sort of contradiction which is
realized in man. Why is he forced to do violence to himself
by leaving his individuality, and, inversely, why is the impersonal
law obliged to be dissipated by incarnating itself
in individuals? Is it answered that there are two antagonistic
worlds in which we participate equally, the world of matter
and sense on the one hand, and the world of pure and impersonal
reason on the other? That is merely repeating the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
question in slightly different terms, for what we are trying to
find out is why we must lead these two existences at the same
time. Why do these two worlds, which seem to contradict
each other, not remain outside of each other, and why must
they mutually penetrate one another in spite of their antagonism?
The only explanation which has ever been given
of this singular necessity is the hypothesis of the Fall, with
all the difficulties which it implies, and which need not be
repeated here. On the other hand, all mystery disappears the
moment that it is recognized that impersonal reason is only
another name given to collective thought. For this is possible
only through a group of individuals; it supposes them, and
in their turn, they suppose it, for they can continue to exist
only by grouping themselves together. The kingdom of ends
and impersonal truths can realize itself only by the co-operation
of particular wills, and the reasons for which these participate
in it are the same as those for which they co-operate. In a
word, there is something impersonal in us because there is
something social in all of us, and since social life embraces
at once both representations and practices, this impersonality
naturally extends to ideas as well as to acts.</p>

<p>Perhaps some will be surprised to see us connect the most
elevated forms of thought with society: the cause appears
quite humble, in consideration of the value which we attribute
to the effect. Between the world of the senses and appetites
on the one hand, and that of reason and morals on the other,
the distance is so considerable that the second would seem
to have been able to add itself to the first only by a creative
act. But attributing to society this preponderating r&ocirc;le in
the genesis of our nature is not denying this creation; for
society has a creative power which no other observable being
can equal. In fact, all creation, if not a mystical operation
which escapes science and knowledge, is the product of a
synthesis. Now if the synthesis of particular conceptions
which take place in each individual consciousness are already
and of themselves productive of novelties, how much more
efficacious these vast syntheses of complete consciousnesses
which make society must be! A society is the most powerful
combination of physical and moral forces of which nature offers
us an example. Nowhere else is an equal richness of different
materials, carried to such a degree of concentration, to be found.
Then it is not surprising that a higher life disengages itself
which, by reacting upon the elements of which it is the product,
raises them to a higher plane of existence and transforms
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus sociology appears destined to open a new way to
the science of man. Up to the present, thinkers were placed
before this double alternative: either explain the superior
and specific faculties of men by connecting them to the
inferior forms of his being, the reason to the senses, or the mind
to matter, which is equivalent to denying their uniqueness; or
else attach them to some super-experimental reality which was
postulated, but whose existence could be established by no
observation. What put them in this difficulty was the fact
that the individual passed as being the <i>finis natur&aelig;</i>&mdash;the
ultimate creation of nature; it seemed that there was nothing
beyond him, or at least nothing that science could touch.
But from the moment when it is recognized that above the
individual there is society, and that this is not a nominal
being created by reason, but a system of active forces, a new
manner of explaining men becomes possible. To conserve
his distinctive traits it is no longer necessary to put them
outside experience. At least, before going to this last extremity,
it would be well to see if that which surpasses the individual,
though it is within him, does not come from this super-individual
reality which we experience in society. To be sure, it cannot be
said at present to what point these explanations may be able to
reach, and whether or not they are of a nature to resolve all the
problems. But it is equally impossible to mark in advance
a limit beyond which they cannot go. What must be done
is to try the hypothesis and submit it as methodically as
possible to the control of facts. This is what we have tried
to do.</p>

and we shall call the men of these societies primitives. Undoubtedly the expression
lacks precision, but that is hardly evitable, and besides, when we have
taken pains to fix the meaning, it is not inconvenient.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> But that is not equivalent to saying that all luxury is lacking to the primitive
cults. On the contrary, we shall see that in every religion there are beliefs and
practices which do not aim at strictly utilitarian ends (Bk. III, ch. iv, &sect; 2). This
luxury is indispensable to the religious life; it is at its very heart. But it is
much more rudimentary in the inferior religions than in the others, so we are
better able to determine its reason for existence here.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It is seen that we give a wholly relative sense to this word "origins," just
as to the word "primitive." By it we do not mean an absolute beginning, but
the most simple social condition that is actually known or that beyond which
we cannot go at present. When we speak of the origins or of the commencement
of religious history or thought, it is in this sense that our statements should be
understood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> We say that time and space are categories because there is no difference
between the r&ocirc;le played by these ideas in the intellectual life and that which
falls to the ideas of class or cause (on this point see, Hamelin, <i>Essai sur les
&eacute;l&eacute;ments principaux de la repr&eacute;sentation</i>, pp. 63, 76).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> See the support given this assertion in Hubert and Mauss, <i>M&eacute;langes

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Thus we see all the difference which exists between the group of sensations
and images which serve to locate us in time, and the category of time. The
first are the summary of individual experiences, which are of value only for the
person who experienced them. But what the category of time expresses is a
time common to the group, a social time, so to speak. In itself it is a veritable
social institution. Also, it is peculiar to man; animals have no representations
of this sort.
</p><p>
This distinction between the category of time and the corresponding sensations
could be made equally well in regard to space or cause. Perhaps this would
aid in clearing up certain confusions which are maintained by the controversies
of which these questions are the subject. We shall return to this point in the
conclusion of the present work (&sect; 4).</p></div>

their organo-physical constitution, are spontaneously affected in the same
manner by the different parts of space: which is more improbable, especially
as in themselves the different regions are sympathetically indifferent. Also,
the divisions of space vary with different societies, which is a proof that they are
not founded exclusively upon the congenital nature of man.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> We do not mean to say that mythological thought ignores it, but that
it contradicts it more frequently and openly than scientific thought does.
Inversely, we shall show that science cannot escape violating it, though it
holds to it far more scrupulously than religion does. On this subject, as on
many others, there are only differences of degree between science and religion;
but if these differences should not be exaggerated, they must be noted, for they
are significant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> This hypothesis has already been set forth by the founders of the <i>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</i>.
It is especially remarked in a short article by Windelbrand entitled
<i>Die Erkenntnisslehre unter dem V&ouml;lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunke</i>, in the
<i>Zeitsch. f. V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</i>, viii, pp. 166 ff. Cf. a note of Steinthal on the same
subject, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 178 ff.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Even in the theory of Spencer, it is by individual experience that the
categories are made. The only difference which there is in this regard between
ordinary empiricism and evolutionary empiricism is that according to this
latter, the results of individual experience are accumulated by heredity. But
this accumulation adds nothing essential to them; no element enters into their
composition which does not have its origin in the experience of the individual.
According to this theory, also, the necessity with which the categories actually
impose themselves upon us is the product of an illusion and a superstitious
prejudice, strongly rooted in the organism, to be sure, but without foundation in
the nature of things.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Perhaps some will be surprised that we do not define the apriorist theory
by the hypothesis of innateness. But this conception really plays a secondary
part in the doctrine. It is a simple way of stating the impossibility of reducing
rational knowledge to empirical data. Saying that the former is innate is only
a positive way of saying that it is not the product of experience, such as it is
ordinarily conceived.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> At least, in so far as there are any representations which are individual
and hence wholly empirical. But there are in fact probably none where the two
elements are not found closely united.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This irreducibility must not be taken in any absolute sense. We do not
wish to say that there is nothing in the empirical representations which shows
rational ones, nor that there is nothing in the individual which could be taken
as a sign of social life. If experience were completely separated from all that
is rational, reason could not operate upon it; in the same way, if the psychic
nature of the individual were absolutely opposed to the social life, society would
be impossible. A complete analysis of the categories should seek these germs of
rationality even in the individual consciousness. We shall have occasion to
come back to this point in our conclusion. All that we wish to establish here
is that between these indistinct germs of reason and the reason properly so called,
there is a difference comparable to that which separates the properties of the
mineral elements out of which a living being is composed from the characteristic
attributes of life after this has once been constituted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> It has frequently been remarked that social disturbances result in multiplying
mental disturbances. This is one more proof that logical discipline is
a special aspect of social discipline. The first gives way as the second is weakened.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> There is an analogy between this logical necessity and moral obligation but
there is not an actual identity. To-day society treats criminals in a different
fashion than subjects whose intelligence only is abnormal; that is a proof that
the authority attached to logical rules and that inherent in moral rules are not
of the same nature, in spite of certain similarities. They are two species of the
same class. It would be interesting to make a study on the nature and origin of
this difference, which is probably not primitive, for during a long time, the
public conscience has poorly distinguished between the deranged and the
delinquent. We confine ourselves to signalizing this question. By this example,
one may see the number of problems which are raised by the analysis of these
notions which generally pass as being elementary and simple, but which are
really of an extreme complexity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> This question will be treated again in the conclusion of this work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The rationalism which is imminent in the sociological theory of knowledge
is thus midway between the classical empiricism and apriorism. For the first,
the categories are purely artificial constructions; for the second, on the contrary,
they are given by nature; for us, they are in a sense a work of art, but of an art
which imitates nature with a perfection capable of increasing unlimitedly.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> For example, that which is at the foundation of the category of time is the
rhythm of social life; but if there is a rhythm in collective life, one may rest
assured that there is another in the life of the individual, and more generally,
in that of the universe. The first is merely more marked and apparent than the
others. In the same way, we shall see that the notion of class is founded on that
of the human group. But if men form natural groups, it can be assumed that
among things there exists groups which are at once analogous and different.
Classes and species are natural groups of things.
</p><p>
If it seems to many minds that a social origin cannot be attributed to the
categories without depriving them of all speculative value, it is because society
is still too frequently regarded as something that is not natural; hence it is
concluded that the representations which express it express nothing in nature.
But the conclusion is not worth more than the premise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This is how it is legitimate to compare the categories to tools; for on its
side, a tool is material accumulated capital. There is a close relationship between
the three ideas of tool, category and institution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> We have already attempted to define religious phenomena in a paper
which was published in the <i>Ann&eacute;e Sociologique</i> (Vol. II, pp. 1 ff.). The definition
then given differs, as will be seen, from the one we give to-day. At the end
of this chapter (p. 47, n. 1), we shall explain the reasons which have led us to
these modifications, but which imply no essential change in the conception of
the facts.</p></div>

public religion is not merely the development of an interior and personal
religion which was the primitive fact, or whether, on the contrary, the second
is not the projection of the first into individual consciences. The problem
will be directly attacked below (Bk. II, ch. v, &sect; 2, cf. the same book, ch. vi and
vii, &sect; 1). For the moment, we confine ourselves to remarking that the individual
cult is presented to the observer as an element of, and something dependent upon,
the collective cult.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> It is by this that our present definition is connected to the one we have
already proposed in the <i>Ann&eacute;e Sociologique</i>. In this other work, we defined
religious beliefs exclusively by their obligatory character; but, as we shall show,
this obligation evidently comes from the fact that these beliefs are the possession
of a group which imposes them upon its members. The two definitions are thus
in a large part the same. If we have thought it best to propose a new one, it is
because the first was too formal, and neglected the contents of the religious
representations too much. It will be seen, in the discussions which follow, how
important it is to put this characteristic into evidence at once. Moreover, if
their imperative character is really a distinctive trait of religious beliefs, it allows
of an infinite number of degrees; consequently there are even cases where it is
not easily perceptible. Hence come difficulties and embarrassments which are
avoided by substituting for this criterium the one we now employ.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> We thus leave aside here those theories which, in whole or in part, make
use of super-experimental data. This is the case with the theory which Andrew
Lang exposed in his book, <i>The Making of Religion</i>, and which Father Schmidt
has taken up again, with variations of detail, in a series of articles on <i>The Origin
of the Idea of God</i> (<i>Anthropos</i>, 1908, 1909). Lang does not set animism definitely
aside, but in the last analysis, he admits a sense or intuition of the divine directly.
Also, if we do not consider it necessary to expose and discuss this conception in
the present chapter, we do not intend to pass it over in silence; we shall come
to it again below, when we shall ourselves explain the facts upon which it is
founded (Bk. II, ch. ix, &sect; 4).</p></div>

characterized by almost as much intercourse with the dead as their waking are
with the living" (<i>Primitive Culture</i>, I, p. 443). In regard to these peoples, the
same author cites this remark of an observer: "<i>All their dreams</i> are construed
into visits from the spirits of their deceased friends" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 443). This statement
is certainly exaggerated; but it is one more proof of the frequency of
mystic dreams among the primitives. The etymology which Strehlow proposes
for the Arunta word <i>altjirerama</i>, which means "to dream," also tends to confirm
this theory. This word is composed of <i>altjira</i>, which Strehlow translates by
"god" and <i>rama</i>, which means "see." Thus a dream would be the moment
when a man is in relations with sacred beings (<i>Die Aranda- und Loritja-St&auml;mme</i>,

suggested to men by their dream experiences, believes that he can derive it
from other empirical data: these are the data of spiritualism (telepathy, distance-seeing,
etc.). We do not consider it necessary to discuss the theory such as it
has been exposed in his book <i>The Making of Religion</i>. It reposes upon the
hypothesis that spiritualism is a fact of constant observation, and that distance-seeing
is a real faculty of men, or at least of certain men, but it is well known
how much this theory is scientifically contested. What is still more contestable
is that the facts of spiritualism are apparent enough and of a sufficient frequency
to have been able to serve as the basis for all the religious beliefs and practices
which are connected with souls and spirits. The examination of these questions
would carry us too far from what is the object of our study. It is still less
necessary to engage ourselves in this examination, since the theory of Lang
remains open to many of the objections which we shall address to that of Tylor
in the paragraphs which follow.</p></div>

the soul comes from dreams, and that after it was created, men projected it into
things. But, he adds, the fact that nature has been conceived as animated like
men does not explain how it became the object of a cult. "The man who believes
the bowing tree or the leaping flame to be a living thing like himself, does not
therefore believe it to be a supernatural being&mdash;rather, so far as it is like himself,
it, like himself, is not supernatural" (<i>Introduction to the History of Religions</i>,

spirits: this is the idea that "the power which manifests itself inside the
consciousness is a different form of power from that manifested outside the
consciousness" (<i>Ecclesiastical Institutions</i>, &sect; 659). Spencer understands by this
that the notion of force in general is the sentiment of the force which we have
extended to the entire universe; this is what animism admits implicitly when it
peoples nature with spirits analogous to our own. But even if this hypothesis in
regard to the way in which the idea of force is formed were true&mdash;and it requires
important reservations which we shall make (Bk. III, ch. iii, &sect; 3)&mdash;it has nothing
religious about it; it belongs to no cult. It thus remains that the system of
religious symbols and rites, the classification of things into sacred and profane,
all that which is really religious in religion, corresponds to nothing in reality.
Also, this germ of truth, of which he speaks, is still more a germ of error, for if it
be true that the forces of nature and those of the mind are related, they are
profoundly distinct, and one exposes himself to grave misconceptions in identifying
them.</p></div>

Christianity the climax of all this development. The religion of ancestors, he

one at the basis of the teaching of Christ? (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 378 ff.). It is useless to
insist upon the strangeness of the conception which makes Christianity the latest
of the cults of the dead.</p></div>

(especially of hygiene) whose provisions, though placed under the sanction of
imaginary beings, are nevertheless well founded. But we shall not delay to
discuss a conception so insupportable, and which has, in fact, never been sustained
in a systematic manner by persons somewhat informed upon the history of
religions. It is difficult to see what good the terrible practices of the initiation
bring to the health which they threaten; what good the dietetic restrictions,
which generally deal with perfectly clean animals, have hygienically; how
sacrifices, which take place far from a house, make it more solid, etc. Undoubtedly
there are religious precepts which at the same time have a practical utility; but
they are lost in the mass of others, and even the services which they render are
frequently not without some drawbacks. If there is a religiously enforced
cleanliness, there is also a religious filthiness which is derived from these same
principles. The rule which orders a corpse to be carried away from the camp
because it is the seat of a dreaded spirit is undoubtedly useful. But the same
belief requires the relatives to anoint themselves with the liquids which issue
from a corpse in putrefaction, because they are supposed to have exceptional
virtues.&mdash;From this point of view, magic has served a great deal more than
religion.</p></div>

in spite of all mythological obscurations, the name of the Supreme Deity"
(<i>Science of Language</i>, II, p. 478). We shall not dispute this assertion, though
it is historically contestable; but in any case, this conception of Zeus could never
have been more than a glimmer in the midst of all the other religious beliefs of
the Greeks.
</p><p>
Besides this, in a later work, Max M&uuml;ller went so far as to make even the
notion of god in general the product of a wholly verbal process and thus of
a mythological elaboration (<i>Physic. Rel.</i>, p. 138).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> Undoubtedly outside the real myths there were always fables which were
not believed, or at least were not believed in the same way and to the same
degree, and hence had no religious character. The line of demarcation between
fables and myths is certainly floating and hard to determine. But this is no
reason for making all myths stories, any more than we should dream of making
all stories myths. There is at least one characteristic which in a number of cases
suffices to differentiate the religious myth: that is its relation to the cult.</p></div>

words. Sensuous experience, he says, implies, at least in certain cases, "beyond
the known, <i>something unknown, something which I claim the liberty to call infinite</i>"
(<i>Natural Rel.</i>, p. 195; cf. p. 218). The unknown is not necessarily the infinite,
any more than the infinite is necessarily the unknown if it is in all points the
same, and consequently like the part which we know. It would be necessary to
prove that the part of it which we perceive differs in nature from that which we
do not perceive.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_173_173" id="Footnote_173_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> Max M&uuml;ller involuntarily recognizes this in certain passages. He confesses
that he sees little difference between Agni, the god of fire, and the notion of
ether, by which the modern physicist explains light and heat (<i>Phys. Rel.</i>, pp.
126 f.). Also, he connects the notion of divinity to that of agency (p. 138) or
of a causality which is not natural and profane. The fact that religion represents
the causes thus imagined, under the form of personal agents, is not enough
to explain how they got a sacred character. A personal agent can be profane, and
also, many religious forces are essentially impersonal.</p></div>

already described the social organization of the Wuaramongo (Warramunga of
Spencer and Gillen) in 1888 in his <i>Further Notes on the Australian Classes</i> in <i>The
Journal of the Anthropological Institute</i> (hereafter, <i>J.A.I.</i>), pp. 44 f. The Arunta
had already been briefly studied by Schulze (<i>The Aborigines of the Upper and

XIV, fasc. 2): the organization of the Chingalee (the Tjingilli of Spencer and

this publication. Not only has he charged himself with editing the manuscripts
of Strehlow, but by his judicious questions he has led the latter to be more

and Exogamy</i>, shows an important progress in the thought as well as the method
of Frazer. Every time that he describes the religious or domestic institutions
of a tribe, he sets himself to determine the geographic and social conditions in
which this tribe is placed. Howsoever summary these analyses may be, they
bear witness nevertheless to a rupture with the old methods of the anthropological
school.</p></div>

religions is to find out what the religious nature of man really consists in. However,
as we do not regard it as a part of his constitutional make-up, but rather as
the product of social causes, we consider it impossible to find it, if we leave aside
his social environment.</p></div>

kinship results solely from a common name; it is in this sense that the <i>gens</i> is a
clan. But the totemic clan is a particular sort of the class thus constituted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_217_217" id="Footnote_217_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_217_217"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> In a certain sense, these bonds of solidarity extend even beyond the frontiers
of the tribe. When individuals of different tribes have the same totem, they
have peculiar duties towards each other. This fact is expressly stated for certain
tribes of North America (see Frazer, <i>Totemism and Exogamy</i>, III, pp. 57, 81, 299,
356-357). The texts relative to Australia are less explicit. However, it is
probable that the prohibition of marriage between members of a single totem is
international.</p></div>

exactly how it is written. Some write <i>totam</i>, others <i>toodaim</i>, or <i>dodaim</i>, or
<i>ododam</i> (see Frazer, <i>Totemism</i>, p. 1). Nor is the meaning of the word determined
exactly. According to the report of the first observer of the Ojibway, J. Long,
the word <i>totam</i> designated the protecting genius, the individual totem, of which
we shall speak below (Bk. II, ch. iv) and not the totem of the clan. But the
accounts of other explorers say exactly the contrary (on this point, see Frazer,
<i>Totemism and Exogamy</i>, III, pp. 49-52).</p></div>

the boomerang, cold weather, darkness, fire, lightning, the moon, red ochre,
resin, salt water, the evening star, a stone, the sun, water, the whirlwind, the

him laughing in the rocks which are his residence (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, pp. 207, 215, 226
note). According to a myth given on p. 422, there was an initial group of
mythical Thaballa (cf. p. 208). The clan of the Kati, "full-grown men," as
Spencer and Gillen say, seems to be of the same sort (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, p. 207).</p></div>

interest for the question of religion and that of the family, for the clan is a
family. In the lower societies, these two problems are very closely connected.
But both are so complex that it is indispensable to treat them separately. Also,
the primitive family organization cannot be understood before the primitive
religious beliefs are known; for the latter serve as the basis of the former. This
is why it is necessary to study totemism as a religion before studying the totemic
clan as a family group.</p></div>

ancestor becomes reincarnate in the body of the mother and becomes the soul of
the child; according to Strehlow (II, pp. 51 ff.), the conception, though being the
work of the ancestor, does not imply any reincarnation; but in neither interpretation
does the totem of the child necessarily depend upon that of the parents.</p></div>

which determines the totem of the child. Each totem, as we shall see, has its
centre and the ancestors preferably frequent the places serving as centres for
their respective totems. The totem of the child is therefore that which belongs
to the place where the mother believes that she conceived. As this should
generally be in the vicinity of the place which serves as totemic centre for her
husband, the child should generally follow the totem of his father. It is undoubtedly
this which explains why the greater part of the inhabitants of a given
locality belong to the same totem (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 9).</p></div>

the Paruinji and the Milpulko, designates the eagle-hawk, according to Brough
Smyth; now one of the clans of this phratry has the eagle-hawk as totem. But
here the animal is designated by the word Bilyara. Many cases of the same

phratries equally. This fact seems doubtful to us. It is very possible that the
two clans may have two varieties of pelicans as totems. Information given by
Mathews on the same tribe seems to point to this (<i>Aboriginal Tribes of N.S. Wales
and Victoria</i>, in <i>Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of N.S. Wales</i>, 1904,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_257_257" id="Footnote_257_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> This principle is not maintained everywhere with an equal strictness. In
the central tribes of eight classes notably, beside the class with which marriage
is regularly permitted, there is another with which a sort of secondary concubinage
is allowed (Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nor. Tr.</i>, p. 106). It is the same with
certain tribes of four classes. Each class has a choice between the two classes
of the other phratry. This is the case with the Kabi (see Mathews, <i>in</i> Curr, III,
162).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_259_259" id="Footnote_259_259"></a><a href="#FNanchor_259_259"><span class="label">[259]</span></a> Nevertheless, some tribes are cited where the matrimonial classes bear the
names of animals or plants: this is the case with the Kabi (Mathew, <i>Two Representative
Tribes</i>, p. 150), the tribes observed by Mrs. Bates (<i>The Marriage Laws
and Customs of the West Australian Aborigines</i>, in <i>Victorian Geographical Journal</i>,
XXIII-XXIV, p. 47), and perhaps in two tribes observed by Palmer. But
these facts are very rare and their significance badly established. Also, it is not
surprising that the classes, as well as the sexual groups, should sometimes adopt
the names of animals. This exceptional extension of the totemic denominations
in no way modifies our conception of totemism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_260_260" id="Footnote_260_260"></a><a href="#FNanchor_260_260"><span class="label">[260]</span></a> Perhaps the same explanation is applicable to certain other tribes of the
South-East and the East where, if we are to believe the informers of Howitt,
totems specially attached to each matrimonial class are to be found. This is the
case among the Wiradjuri, the Wakelbura and the Bunta-Murra on the Bulloo
River (Howitt, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, pp. 210, 221, 226). However, the evidence collected is
suspect, according to his own admission. In fact, it appears from the lists which
he has drawn up, that many totems are found equally in the two classes of the
same phratry.
</p><p>
The explanation which we propose, after Frazer (<i>Totemism and Exogamy</i>,
pp. 531 ff.), raises one difficulty. In principle, each clan and consequently each
totem, is represented equally in the two classes of a single phratry, since one of
the classes is that of the children and the other that of the parents from whom
the former get their totems. So when the clans disappeared, the totemic interdictions
which survived should have remained in both matrimonial classes,
while in the actual cases cited, each class has its own. Whence comes this
differentiation? The example of the Kaiabara (a tribe of southern Queensland)
allows us to see how it may have come about. In this tribe, the children have
the totem of their mother, but it is particularized by some distinctive mark. If
the mother has the black eagle-hawk as totem, the child has the white eagle-hawk
(Howitt, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 229). This appears to be the beginning of a tendency
for the totems to differentiate themselves according to the matrimonial classes.</p></div>

that of the phratries. In fact, usage permits a clan to sell or give away the right
of bearing its totem, as a result of which each clan has a number of totems, some
of which it has in common with other clans (see Swanton, pp. 107 and 268).
Since Swanton calls the phratries clans, he is obliged to give the name of <i>family</i>
to the real clans, and of <i>household</i> to the regular families. But the real sense of
his terminology is not to be doubted.</p></div>

specially studying, these tattooings are put on the animals which belong to the
clan. The Bechuana of South Africa are divided into a certain number of clans;
there are the people of the crocodile, the buffalo, the monkey, etc. Now the
crocodile people, for example, make an incision in the ears of their cattle whose

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_307_307" id="Footnote_307_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_307_307"><span class="label">[307]</span></a> This is the case, for example, among the Warramunga, the Walpari, the
Wulmala, the Tjingilli, the Umbaia and the Unmatjera (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, 339, 348).
Among the Warramunga, at the moment when the design is executed, the performers
address the initiated with the following words: "That mark belongs to
your place; do not look out along another place."  "This means," say Spencer
and Gillen, "that the young man must not interfere with ceremonies belonging
to other totems than his own: it also indicates the very close association which
is supposed to exist between a man and his totem and any spot especially connected
with the totem" (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, p. 584 and n.). Among the Warramunga, the
totem is transmitted from father to child, so each locality has its own.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_308_308" id="Footnote_308_308"></a><a href="#FNanchor_308_308"><span class="label">[308]</span></a> Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, pp. 215, 241, 376.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_309_309" id="Footnote_309_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_309_309"><span class="label">[309]</span></a> It will be remembered (see above, p. 107) that in this tribe, the child may
have a different totem than his father, his mother, or his relatives in general.
Now the relatives on both sides are the performers designated for the ceremonies
of initiation. Consequently, since in principle a man can have the quality of
performer or officiant only for the ceremonies of his own totem, it follows that in
certain cases the rites by which the young man is initiated must be in connection
with a totem that is not his own. That is why the paintings made on the body
of the novice do not necessarily represent his own totem: cases of this sort will
be found in Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 229. That there is an anomaly here
is well shown by the fact that the circumcision falls to the totem which predominates
in the local group of the initiate, that is to say, to the one which
would be the totem of the initiate himself, if the totemic organization were not
disturbed, if among the Arunta it were what it is among the Warramunga (see
Spencer and Gillen, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 219).
</p><p>
The same disturbance has had another consequence. In a general way, its
effect is to extend a little the bonds attaching each totem to a special group,
since each totem may have members in all the local groups possible, and even in
the two phratries. The idea that these ceremonies of a totem might be celebrated
by an individual of another totem&mdash;an idea which is contrary to the very
principles of totemism, as we shall see better after a while&mdash;has thus been
accepted without too much resistance. It has been admitted that a man to
whom a spirit revealed the formula for a ceremony had the right of presiding
over it, even when he was not of the totem in question himself (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 519).
But that this is an exception to the rule and the product of a sort of toleration is
proved by the fact that the beneficiary of the formula does not have the free
disposition of it; if he transmits it&mdash;and these transmissions are frequent&mdash;it can
be only to a member of the totem which the rite concerns (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).</p></div>

word. "This word," he says, "means that which is secret and personal <i>(der
eigene geheime</i>). <i>Tju</i> is an old word which means hidden or secret, and <i>runga</i>
means that which is my own." But Kempe, who has more authority than
Strehlow in this matter, translates <i>tju</i> by great, powerful, sacred (<i>Kempe,
Vocabulary of the Tribes inhabiting Macdonell Ranges</i>, s.v. <i>Tju</i>, in <i>Transactions
of the R. Society of Victoria</i>, Vol. XIII). At bottom, the translation of Strehlow
is not so different from the other as might appear at first glance, for what is
secret is hidden from the knowledge of the profane, that is, it is sacred. As for
the meaning given to <i>runga</i>, it appears to us very doubtful. The ceremonies of
the emu belong to all the members of that clan; all may participate in them;
therefore they are not personal to any one of them.</p></div>

been unable to determine. They merely note that it "is regarded as something

the Wild Cat totem. As this animal is the object of a tribal cult, the veneration
of which it is the object might easily be common to all the clans.</p></div>

represented as nourishing themselves <i>regularly</i> with their totem. Consumption
of this sort is, on the contrary, the exception. Their ordinary food, according to
Strehlow, was the same as that of the corresponding animal (see Strehlow, I, p. 4).</p></div>

Spencer and Gillen, as well as Frazer, admit that the tribes of central Australia,
and especially the Arunta, represent the most archaic and consequently the
purest form of totemism. We shall presently say why this conjecture seems to
us to be contrary to all probability. It is even probable that these authors would
not have accepted their thesis so readily if they had not refused to regard
totemism as a religion and if they had not consequently misunderstood the
sacred character of the totem.</p></div>

when an interdiction is not observed, it is the other phratry which revenges this
sacrilege (see above, p. 129, n. 2). It is because it has an interest in seeing that
the rule is observed. In fact, they believe that when the rule is broken, the
totemic species may not reproduce abundantly. Now the members of the other
phratry consume it regularly: therefore it is they who are affected. That is
why they revenge themselves.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_378_378" id="Footnote_378_378"></a><a href="#FNanchor_378_378"><span class="label">[378]</span></a> This is the case among the Loritja (Strehlow, II, pp. 60, 61), the Worgaia,
the Warramunga, the Walpari, the Mara, the Anula and the Binbinga (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>,
pp. 166, 167, 171, 173). It may be eaten by a Warramunga or a Walpari, but
only when offered by a member of the other phratry. Spencer and Gillen remark
(p. 167, n.), that in this regard the paternal and the maternal totems appear to be
under different rules. It is true that in both cases the offer must come from the
other phratry. But when it is a question of the paternal totem, or the totem
properly so-called, this phratry is the one to which the totem does not belong;
for the maternal totem, the contrary is the case. Probably the principle was
first established for the former, then mechanically extended to the other, though
the situation was different. When the rule had once become established that the
prohibition protecting the totem could be neglected only on the invitation of the
other phratry, it was applied also to the maternal totem.</p></div>

certain examples of which we have just cited, are really of a totemic nature, for
many of them have no direct connection with the animal that serves as totem of
the clan. Thus in the sub-clan of the Eagle, the characteristic interdiction is
against touching the head of a buffalo (Dorsey, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 239); in another sub-clan
with the same totem, they must not touch verdigris, charcoal, etc. (<i>ibid.</i>,
p. 245).
</p><p>
We do not mention other interdictions mentioned by Frazer, such as those of
naming or looking at the animal or plant, for it is still less certain that they
are of totemic origin, except perhaps for certain facts observed among the
Bechuana (<i>Totemism</i>, pp. 12-13). Frazer admits too readily&mdash;and in this regard,
he has imitators&mdash;that the prohibitions against eating or touching an animal
depend upon totemic beliefs. However, there is one case in Australia, where the
sight of the animal seems to be forbidden. According to Strehlow (II, p. 59),
among the Arunta and the Loritja, a man who has the moon as totem must not
look at it very long, or he would be likely to die at the hand of an enemy. But
we believe that this is a unique case. We must not forget, also, that astronomical
totems were probably not primitive in Australia, so this prohibition may be the
product of a complex elaboration. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that
among the Euahlayi, looking at the moon is forbidden to all mothers and children,
no matter what their totems may be (L. Parker, <i>The Euahlayi</i>, p. 53).</p></div>

initiation rites in this mythical theme. The initiation also has the object of
making the young man into a complete man, and on the other hand, it also
implies actual surgical operations (circumcision, sub-incision, the extraction of
teeth, etc.). The processes which served to form the first men would naturally
be conceived on the same model.</p></div>

had been forced to leave the lake where they dwelt and seek another home.
One of them, which was larger than the others, stood this exercise very badly
owing to the heat. It made such violent efforts that it got out of its shell. The
process of transformation, being once commenced, went on by itself and the
turtle finally became a man who was the ancestor of the clan (Erminnie A. Smith,
<i>The Myths of the Iroquois, IInd Report</i>, p. 77). The Crab clan of the Choctaw
was formed in a similar manner. Some men surprised a certain number of crabs
that lived in the neighbourhood, took them home with them, taught them to talk
and to walk, and finally adopted them into their society (Catlin, <i>North American
Indians</i>, II, p. 128).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_398_398" id="Footnote_398_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_398_398"><span class="label">[398]</span></a> For example, here is a legend of the Tsimshian. In the course of a hunt, an
Indian met a black bear which took him to its home, and taught him to catch
salmon and build canoes. The man stayed with the bear for two years, and then
returned to his native village. But the people were afraid of him, because he
was just like a bear. He could not talk or eat anything except raw food. Then
he was rubbed with magic herbs and gradually regained his original form. After
that, whenever he was in trouble, he called upon his bear friends, who came to
aid him. He built a house and painted a bear on the foundation. His sister
made a blanket for the dance, upon which a bear was designed. That is why the
descendants of this sister had the bear as their emblem (Boas, <i>Kwakiutl</i>, p. 323.
Cf. <i>Vth Rep. on the N.W. Tribes of Canada</i>, pp. 23, 29 ff.; Hill Tout, <i>Report on the
Ethnology of the Statlumh of British Columbia</i>, in <i>J.A.I.</i>, 1905, XXXV, p. 150).
</p><p>
Thus we see the inconveniences in making this mystical relationship between
the man and the animal the distinctive characteristic of totemism, as M. Van
Gennep proposes (<i>Tot&eacute;misme et m&eacute;thode comparative</i>, in <i>Revue de l'histoire des
religions</i>, Vol. LVIII, July, 1908, p. 55). This relationship is a mythical representation
of otherwise profound facts; but it may be omitted without causing
the disappearance of the essential traits of totemism. Undoubtedly there are
always close bonds between the people of the clan and the totemic animal, but
these are not necessarily bonds of blood-relationship, though they are frequently
conceived in this form.</p></div>

between the man and the animal is still more carefully stated. It is said that the
clan is descended from a mixed union, if we may so speak, that is to say, one
where either the husband or the wife was an animal of the species whose name the
clan bears (see Swanton, <i>Social Condition, Beliefs, etc., of the Tlinkit Indians</i>,

up in the morning, he pronounces in a rather low voice the name of the animal
after which he is named himself. The purpose of this practice is to make the
man clever or lucky in the hunt, or be forewarned of the dangers to which he may
be exposed from this animal. For example, a man who has a species of serpent
as his totem is protected from bites if this invocation has been made regularly.</p></div>

every animal has two aspects. First, it is an ordinary animal to be hunted and
eaten; but it is also a supernatural being in the animal's form, upon which men
depend. The mythical beings corresponding to cosmic phenomena have the same
ambiguity (Swanton, <i>ibid.</i>, 16, 14, 25).</p></div>

the same opposition is found between the two phratries of the Arunta: one
includes the men of a water totem, the other those of earth (Strehlow, I, p. 6).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_448_448" id="Footnote_448_448"></a><a href="#FNanchor_448_448"><span class="label">[448]</span></a> Among the Iroquois there is a sort of tournament between the two phratries
(Morgan, <i>Ancient Society</i>, p. 94). Among the Haida, says Swanton, the members
of the two phratries of the Eagle and the Crow "are frequently considered
as avowed enemies. Husband and wife (who must be of different phratries) do
not hesitate to betray each other" (<i>The Haida</i>, p. 62). In Australia this hostility
is carried into the myths. The two animals serving the phratries as totems are
frequently represented as in a perpetual war against each other (see J. Mathews,
<i>Eaglehawk and Crow, a study of Australian Aborigines</i>, pp. 14 ff.). In games,
each phratry is the natural rival of the other (Howitt, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 770).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_449_449" id="Footnote_449_449"></a><a href="#FNanchor_449_449"><span class="label">[449]</span></a> So Thomas has wrongly urged against our theory of the origin of the
phratries its inability to explain their opposition (<i>Kinship and Marriage</i>, p. 69).
We do not believe that it is necessary to connect this opposition to that of the
profane and the sacred (see Hertz, <i>La pr&eacute;&eacute;minence de la main droite</i>, in the
<i>Revue Philosophique</i>, Dec., 1909, p. 559). The things of one phratry are not
profane for the other; both are a part of the same religious system (see below,
p. 155).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_450_450" id="Footnote_450_450"></a><a href="#FNanchor_450_450"><span class="label">[450]</span></a> For example, the clan of the Tea-tree includes the grasses, and consequently
herbivorous animals (see <i>Kamilaroi and Kurnai</i>, p. 169). This is undoubtedly
the explanation of a particularity of the totemic emblems of North America
pointed out by Boas. "Among the Tlinkit," he says, "and all the other tribes
of the coast, the emblem of a group includes the animals serving as food to the
one whose name the group bears" (<i>Fifth Rep. of the Committee, etc., British
Association for the Advancement of Science</i>, p. 25).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_451_451" id="Footnote_451_451"></a><a href="#FNanchor_451_451"><span class="label">[451]</span></a> Thus, among the Arunta, frogs are connected with the totem of the gum-tree,
because they are frequently found in the cavities of this tree; water is
related to the water-hen; with the kangaroo is associated a sort of parrot
frequently seen flying about this animal (Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, pp. 146-147,
448).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_452_452" id="Footnote_452_452"></a><a href="#FNanchor_452_452"><span class="label">[452]</span></a> One of the signs of this primitive lack of distinction is that territorial bases
are sometimes assigned to the classes just as to the social divisions with which
they were at first confounded. Thus, among the Wotjobaluk in Australia and
the Zu&ntilde;i in America, things are ideally distributed among the different regions of
space, just as the clans are. Now this regional distribution of things and that of
the clans coincide (see <i>De quelques formes primitives de classification</i>, pp. 34 ff.).
Classifications keep something of this special character even among relatively
advanced peoples, as for example, in China (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 55 ff.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_468_468" id="Footnote_468_468"></a><a href="#FNanchor_468_468"><span class="label">[468]</span></a> However, there are certain tribes in Queensland where the things thus
attributed to a social group are not forbidden for the members of the group:
this is notably the case with the Wakelbura. It is to be remembered that in this
society, it is the matrimonial classes that serve as the framework of the classification
(see above, p. 144). Not only are the men of one class allowed to eat the
animals attributed to this class, but <i>they may eat no others</i>. All other food is
forbidden them (Howitt, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 113; Curr, III, p. 27).
</p><p>
But we must not conclude from this that these animals are considered profane.
In fact, it should be noticed that the individual not only has the privilege of
eating them, but that he is compelled to do so, for he cannot nourish himself
otherwise. Now the imperative nature of this rule is a sure sign that we are in
the presence of things having a religious nature, only this has given rise to
a positive obligation rather than the negative one known as an interdiction.
Perhaps it is not quite impossible to see how this deviation came about. We
have seen above (p. 140) that every individual is thought to have a sort of
property-right over his totem and consequently over the things dependent upon
it.  Perhaps, under the influence of special circumstances, this aspect of the
totemic relation was developed, and they naturally came to believe that only the
members of the clan had the right of disposing of their totem and all that is
connected with it, and that others, on the contrary, did not have the right of
touching it. Under these circumstances, a tribe could nourish itself only on the
food attributed to it.</p></div>

totems are attached to two or three principal totems at the same time. This is
undoubtedly because Strehlow has not been able to establish with certainty
which is the principal totem.
</p><p>
Two interesting facts which appear from this table confirm certain propositions
which we had already formulated. First, the principal totems are nearly all
animals, with but rare exceptions. Also, stars are always only secondary or
associated totems. This is another proof that these latter were only slowly
advanced to the rank of totems and that at first the principal totems were
preferably chosen from the animal kingdom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_477_477" id="Footnote_477_477"></a><a href="#FNanchor_477_477"><span class="label">[477]</span></a> According to the myth, the associate totems served as food to the men
of the principal totem in the fabulous times, or, when these are trees, they gave
their shade (Strehlow, III, p. xii; Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 403). The
fact that the associate totems are believed to have been eaten does not imply that
they are considered profane; for in the mythical period, the principal totem itself
was consumed by the ancestors, the founders of the clan, according to the belief.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_478_478" id="Footnote_478_478"></a><a href="#FNanchor_478_478"><span class="label">[478]</span></a> Thus in the Wild Cat clan, the designs carved on the churinga represent the

the Arunta, there is an animal, the wild cat, which serves as totem to a particular
clan, but which is forbidden for the whole tribe; even the people of other clans
can eat it only very moderately (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 168). But we believe that it would
be an abuse to speak of a tribal totem in this case, for it does not follow from the
fact that the free consumption of an animal is forbidden that this is a totem.
Other causes can also give rise to an interdiction. The religious unity of the tribe
is undoubtedly real, but this is affirmed with the aid of other symbols. We shall
show what these are below (Bk. II, ch. ix).</p></div>

animal takes this part (see Howitt, <i>Australian Medicine Men</i>, <i>J.A.I.</i>, XVI,

escutcheon resembles the image of a saint," says Tylor (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 2). Likewise,

among the Wotjobaluk. "Each individual," he says, "claims some animal, plant
or inanimate object as his special and personal totem, which he inherits from his
mother" (<i>Journ. and Proc. of the Roy. Soc. of N.S. Wales</i>, XXXVIII, p. 291).
But it is evident that if all the children in the same family had the personal
totem of their mother, neither they nor she would really have personal totems at
all. Mathews probably means to say that each individual chooses his individual
totem from the list of things attributed to the clan of his mother. In fact, we
shall see that each clan has its individual totems which are its exclusive property;
the members of the other clans cannot make use of them. In this sense, birth
determines the personal totem to a certain extent, but to a certain extent
only.</p></div>

totems revealed to them in dreams (Howitt, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 387; <i>On Australian

when an old man dreams of something during the night, this thing is the personal
totem of the first person he meets the next day (W. E. Roth, <i>Superstition, Magic

totems are acquired in this way; for in this same tribe another process is used

As we shall presently see, the breath is the soul. When both breathe upon the
skin of the animal, the magician and the recipient each exhale a part of their
souls, which are thus fused, while partaking at the same time of the nature of
the animal, who also takes part in the ceremony in the form of its symbol.</p></div>

to explain this mysterious relationship of the man and the animal in a different
way: it was the sight of the corpse in decomposition which suggested the idea.
When they saw worms coming out of the body, they thought that the soul was
incarnate in them and escaped with them. Worms, and by extension, reptiles
(snakes, lizards, etc.), were therefore the first animals to serve as receptacles for
the souls of the dead, and consequently they were also the first to be venerated
and to play the r&ocirc;le of totems. It was only subsequently that other animals and
plants and even inanimate objects were elevated to the same dignity. But this
hypothesis does not have even the shadow of a proof. Wundt affirms (<i>Mythus
und Religion</i>, II, p. 296) that reptiles are much more common totems than other
animals; from this, he concludes that they are the most primitive. But we
cannot see what justifies this assertion, in the support of which the author cites
no facts. The lists of totems gathered either in Australia or in America do not
show that any special species of animal has played a preponderating r&ocirc;le. Totems
vary from one region to another with the flora and fauna. Moreover, if the circle
of possible totems was so closely limited at first, we cannot see how totemism
was able to satisfy the fundamental principle which says that the two clans or
sub-clans of a tribe must have two different totems.</p></div>

totemism as a section of animalism (II, p. 234).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_581_581" id="Footnote_581_581"></a><a href="#FNanchor_581_581"><span class="label">[581]</span></a> In a later work (<i>The Origin of Totemism</i>, in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, May,
1899, pp. 844-845), Frazer raises this objection himself. "If," he says, "I
deposit my soul in a hare, and my brother John (a member of another clan) shoots
that hare, roasts and swallows it, what becomes of my soul? To meet this
obvious danger it is necessary that John should know the state of my soul, and
that, knowing it, he should, whenever he shoots a hare, take steps to extract and
restore to me my soul before he cooks and dines upon the animal." Now Frazer
believes that he has found this practice in use in Central Australia. Every year,
in the course of a ceremony which we shall describe presently, when the animals
of the new generation arrive at maturity, the first game to be killed is presented
to men of that totem, who eat a little of it; and it is only after this that the
men of the other clans may eat it freely. This, says Frazer, is a way of returning
to the former the souls they may have confided to these animals. But, aside from
the fact that this interpretation of the fact is wholly arbitrary, it is hard not to
find this way of escaping the danger rather peculiar. This ceremony is annual;
long days may have elapsed since the animal was killed. During all this time,
what has become of the soul which it sheltered and the individual whose life
depended on this soul? But it is superfluous to insist upon all the inconceivable
things in this explanation.</p></div>

sometimes, but it always exists (<i>Vth Rep. of the Committee, etc.</i>, p. 25). The fact
that individual forenames are the property of the clan, and characterize it as
surely as the totem, is also found among the Iroquois (Morgan, <i>Ancient Society</i>,
p. 78), the Wyandot (Powell, <i>Wyandot Government</i>, in <i>Ist Rep.</i>, p. 59), the
Shawnee, Sauk and Fox (Morgan, <i>Ancient Society</i>, pp. 72, 76-77) and the Omaha

it must be admitted, that there is a totemism still more ancient than that of the
Arunta: it is the one observed by Rivers in the Banks Islands (<i>Totemism in
Polynesia and Melanesia</i>, in <i>J.A.I.</i>, XXXIX, p. 172). Among the Arunta it is
the spirit of an ancestor who is believed to impregnate the mother; in the Banks
Islands, it is the spirit of an animal or vegetable, as the theory supposes. But
as the ancestral spirits of the Arunta have an animal or vegetable form, the
difference is slight. Therefore we have not mentioned it in our exposition.</p></div>

lacking in Australia. The word churinga, or tjurunga as Strehlow writes, has a
very great similarity, with the Arunta. Spencer and Gillen say that it designates
"all that is secret or sacred. It is applied both to the object and to the quality
it possesses" (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 648, s.v. churinga). This is almost a definition of
mana. Sometimes Spencer and Gillen even use this word to designate religious
power or force in a general way. While describing a ceremony among the Kaitish,
they say that the officiant is "<i>full of churinga</i>," that is to say, they continue, of
the "magic power emanating from the objects called churinga." Yet it does not
seem that the notion of churinga has the same clarity and precision as that of the
mana in Melanesia or of the wakan among the Sioux.</p></div>

to totemism all religious character, in order to make it a sort of magic, it is just
because the forces which the totemic cult puts into play are impersonal like those
employed by the magician. So Frazer recognizes the fundamental fact which we
have just established. But he draws different conclusions because he recognizes
religion only where there are mythical personalities.</p></div>

inexact interpretation of our thought, from which more than one misunderstanding
has resulted. Since we have made constraint the <i>outward sign</i> by which
social facts can be the most easily recognized and distinguished from the facts
of individual psychology, it has been assumed that according to our opinion,
physical constraint is the essential thing for social life. As a matter of fact, we
have never considered it more than the material and apparent expression of an
interior and profound fact which is wholly ideal: this is <i>moral authority</i>. The
problem of sociology&mdash;if we can speak of <i>a</i> sociological problem&mdash;consists in
seeking, among the different forms of external constraint, the different sorts of
moral authority corresponding to them and in discovering the causes which
have determined these latter. The particular question which we are treating
in this present work has as its principal object, the discovery of the form under
which that particular variety of moral authority which is inherent in all that is
religious has been born, and out of what elements it is made. It will be seen
presently that even if we do make social pressure one of the distinctive characteristics
of sociological phenomena, we do not mean to say that it is the only one.
We shall show another aspect of the collective life, nearly opposite to the preceding
one, but none the less real (see p. 212).</p></div>

second, it is because it is more readily observable, for it is translated into outward

without which the great solemnities could not take place (see Howitt, <i>Notes on

rather than its basis. Men have not imagined their duties towards the animals
of the totemic species because they regarded them as kindred, but have imagined
the kinship to explain the nature of the beliefs and rites of which they were the
object. The animal was considered a relative of the man because it was a sacred
being like the man, but it was not treated as a sacred being because it was
regarded as a relative.</p></div>

sentiment. Modern science also tends more and more to admit that the duality
of man and nature does not exclude their unity, and that physical and moral
forces, though distinct, are closely related. We undoubtedly have a different
conception of this unity and relationship than the primitive, but beneath these

materialism of Ratzel (see especially his <i>Politische Geographie</i>), seek to derive all
social life from its material foundation (either economic or territorial). They
commit an error precisely similar to the one committed by Maudsley in individual
psychology. Just as this latter reduced all the psychical life of the individual to
a mere epiphenomenon of his physiological basis, they seek to reduce the whole
psychical life of the group to its physical basis. But they forget that ideas are
realities and forces, and that collective representations are forces even more
powerful and active than individual representations. On this point, see our

number of women's souls still exist to-day. However, they never reincarnate
themselves; since in this tribe the soul animating a new-born child is an old
reincarnated soul, it follows from the fact that women's souls do not reincarnate
themselves, that women cannot have a soul. Moreover, it is possible to explain
whence this absence of reincarnation comes. Filiation among the Gnanji, after
having been uterine, is now in the paternal line: a mother no longer transmits
her totem to her child. So the woman no longer has any descendants to perpetuate
her; she is the <i>finis famili&aelig; su&aelig;</i>. To explain this situation, there are
only two possible hypotheses; either women have no souls, or else they are
destroyed after death. The Gnanji have adopted the former of these two
explanations; certain peoples of Queensland have preferred the latter (see Roth,
<i>Superstition, Magic and Medicine</i>, in <i>N. Queensland Ethnog.</i>, No. 5, &sect; 68).</p></div>

<i>Erathipa</i> from which the <i>spirit children</i>, or the children's souls, disengage themselves,
to enter the bodies of women and fertilize them. According to Spencer
and Gillen, <i>Erathipa</i> means child, though, as they add, it is rarely used in this
sense in ordinary conversation (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 338).</p></div>

of a child is determined by that of his father; inversely, that of the latter may
be deduced from the former (see Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, pp. 70 ff.; Strehlow,
I, pp. 6 ff.). It remains to be seen how the ratapa has a matrimonial class; we

body of a woman belonging to the same matrimonial class as the mother of the

matrimonial classes to the Alcheringa ancestors. His own theory of conception
proves the contrary (cf. II, pp. 53 ff.).</p></div>

to almost nothing, if we observe that, when Spencer and Gillen tell us that the
ancestral soul is incarnated in the woman, the expressions they use are not to be
taken literally. It is not the whole soul which comes to fertilize the mother, but
only an emanation from this soul. In fact, according to their own statement, a
soul equal or even superior in power to the one that is incarnated continues to
live in the nanja tree or rock (see <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 514); we shall have occasion to
come back to this point again (cf. below, p. 275).</p></div>

of the ancestor, but the object in which his soul resides. At bottom, these two
mythological interpretations are identical, and it is easy to see how one has been
able to pass into the other: the body is the place where the soul resides.</p></div>

Gillen is the following one. For these latter, the soul of the individual, after
death, returns to the nanja tree, where it is again confounded with the ancestor's
soul (<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 513); for Strehlow, it goes to the isle of the dead, where it is
finally annihilated. In neither myth does it survive individually. We are not
going to seek the cause of this divergence. It is possible that there has been an
error of observation on the part of Spencer and Gillen, who do not speak of the
isle of the dead. It is also possible that the myth is not the same among the
eastern Arunta, whom Spencer and Gillen observed particularly, as in the other
parts of the tribe.</p></div>

(Tylor, <i>Remarks on Totemism</i>, in <i>J.A.I.</i>, New Series, I, p. 147). It is to be
remarked that the cases where the soul clearly presents itself after death in an
animal form all come from the societies where totemism is more or less perverted.
This is because the idea of the soul is necessarily ambiguous wherever the totemic
beliefs are relatively pure, for totemism implies that it participate in the two
kingdoms at the same time. So it cannot become either one or the other exclusively,
but takes one aspect or the other, according to the circumstances. As
totemism develops, this ambiguity becomes less necessary, while at the same
time, spirits more actively demand attention. Then the marked affinities of the
soul for the animal kingdom are manifested, especially after it is freed from the
human body.</p></div>

essential elements of the idea of the soul, still we do not mean to say that they
are the only ones. Around this central nucleus are grouped other states of
consciousness having this same character, though to a slighter degree. This is
the case with all the superior forms of the intellectual life, owing to the special
price and dignity attributed to them by society. When we devote our lives to
science or art, we feel that we are moving in a circle of things that are above
bodily sensations, as we shall have occasion to show more precisely in our conclusion.
This is why the highest functions of the intelligence have always been
considered specific manifestations of the soul. But they would probably not
have been enough to establish the idea of it.</p></div>

while the soul has always been conceived as multiple, and as capable of
dividing and subdividing itself almost to infinity. But we know to-day that the
unity of the person is also made up of parts and that it, too, is capable of dividing
and decomposing. Yet the notion of personality does not vanish because of the
fact that we no longer think of it as a metaphysical and indivisible atom. It is
the same with the popular conceptions of personality which find their expression
in the idea of the soul. These show that men have always felt that the human
personality does not have that absolute unity attributed to it by certain metaphysicians.</p></div>

is explained from our point of view just as easily as its contrary. If the essential
element of the personality is the social part of us, on the other hand there can be
no social life unless distinct individuals are associated, and this is richer the more
numerous and different from each other they are. So the individual factor is a
condition of the impersonal factor. And the contrary is no less true, for society
itself is an important source of individual differences (see our <i>Division du travail
social</i>, 3rd. ed., pp. 267 ff.).</p></div>

ertnatulunga; they are scattered over different parts of the tribal territory. It
is said that these are places where an isolated ancestor disappeared into the
ground, lost a member, let some blood flow, or lost a churinga which was transformed
into a tree or rock. But these totemic sites have only a secondary importance;
Strehlow calls them <i>kleinere Totempl&auml;tze</i> (I, pp. 4-5). So it may be that
they have taken this character only by analogy with the principal totemic
centres. The trees and rocks which, for some reason or other, remind one of
those found in the neighbourhood of an ertnatulunga, inspire analogous sentiments,
so the myth which was formed in regard to the latter was extended to
the former.</p></div>

conscience of the individual is especially apparent among certain peoples of
Indonesia. "One of the seven souls of the Tobabatak is buried with the placenta;
though preferring to live in this place, it may leave it to warn the individual or
to manifest its approbation when he does well. So in one sense, it plays the r&ocirc;le
of a moral conscience. However, its communications are not confined to the
domain of moral facts. It is called the younger brother of the soul, as the
placenta is called the younger brother of the child.... In war, it inspires the
man with courage to march against the enemy" (Warneck, <i>Der bataksche Ahnen
und Geistercult</i>, in <i>Allg. Missionszeitschrift</i>, Berlin, 1904. p. 10. Cf. Kruijt, <i>Het
Animisme in den indischen Archipel</i>, p. 25).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_897_897" id="Footnote_897_897"></a><a href="#FNanchor_897_897"><span class="label">[897]</span></a> It still remains to be investigated how it comes that after a certain moment
in evolution, this duplication of the soul was made in the form of an individual
totem rather than of a protecting ancestor. Perhaps this question has an
ethnological rather than a sociological interest. However, the manner in which
this substitution was probably effected may be represented as follows.
</p><p>
The individual totem commenced by playing a merely complimentary r&ocirc;le.
Those individuals who wished to acquire powers superior to those possessed by
everybody, did not and could not content themselves with the mere protection
of the ancestor; so they began to look for another assistant of the same sort.
Thus it comes about that among the Euahlayi, the magicians are the only ones
who have or who can procure individual totems. As each one has a collective
totem in addition, he finds himself having many souls. But there is nothing
surprising in this plurality of souls: it is the condition of a superior power.
</p><p>
But when collective totemism once begins to lose ground, and when the
conception of the protecting ancestor consequently begins to grow dim in the
mind, another method must be found for representing the double nature of the
soul, which is still felt. The resulting idea was that, outside of the individual
soul, there was another, charged with watching over the first one. Since this
protecting power was no longer demonstrated by the very fact of birth, men
found it natural to employ, for its discovery, means analogous to those used by
magicians to enter into communion with the forces of whose aid they thus
assured themselves.</p></div>

word is evidently equivalent to Oruncha. Yet there is a difference in the ways

malicious rather than evil; they even say (p. 328) that the Arunta know no
necessarily evil spirits. On the contrary, the regular business of Strehlow's
Erintja is to do evil. Judging from certain myths given by Spencer and Gillen
(<i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 390), they seem to have touched up the figures of the Oruncha a
little: these were originally ogres (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 331).</p></div>

the other, there is the difference that the latter is completely foreign to all that
concerns humanity; he did not make man and does not concern himself with
what they do. The Arunta have neither love nor fear for him. But when this
conception is carefully observed and analysed, it is hard to admit that it is
primitive; for if the Altjira plays no r&ocirc;le, explains nothing, serves for nothing,
what made the Arunta imagine him? Perhaps it is necessary to consider him
as a sort of Baiame who has lost his former prestige, as an ancient god whose
memory is fading away. Perhaps, also, Strehlow has badly interpreted the
testimony he has gathered. According to Eylmann, who, it is to be admitted, is
neither a very competent nor a very sure observer, Altjira made men (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 134). Moreover, among the Loritja, the corresponding personage, Tukura, is
believed to celebrate the initiation ceremonies himself.</p></div>

<i>Anthropos</i> (1908-1909). Replying to Sydney Hartland, who had criticized Lang's
theory in an article entitled <i>The "High Gods" of Australia</i>, in <i>Folk-Lore</i> (Vol. IX,
pp. 290 ff.), Father Schmidt undertook to show that Baiame, Bunjil, etc., are
eternal gods, creators, omnipotent, omniscient and guardians of the moral order.
We are not going to enter into this discussion, which seems to have neither
interest nor importance. If these different adjectives are given a relative sense,
in harmony with the Australian mind, we are quite ready to accept them, and
have even used them ourselves. From this point of view, omnipotent means
having more power than the other sacred beings; omniscient, seeing things that
escape the vulgar and even the greatest magicians; guardian of the moral order,
one causing the rules of Australian morality to be respected, howsoever much
these may differ from our own. But if they want to give these words meanings
which only a spiritualistic Christian could attach to them, it seems useless to
discuss an opinion so contrary to the principles of the historical method.</p></div>

religious and the magic interdictions: on the contrary, it is one whose true
nature is not decided. There are interdicts of folk-lore of which it is hard to say
whether they are religious or magic. But their distinction is necessary, for we
believe that the magic interdicts cannot be understood except as a function of the
religious ones.</p></div>

think, to those between the sacred and the profane. This is the case with the
interdicts of age or rank. For example, in Australia, there are sacred foods
which are reserved for the initiated. But these foods are not all sacred to the
same degree; there is a hierarchy among them. Nor are the initiated all equal.
They do not enjoy all their religious rights from the first, but only enter step by
step into the domain of religious things. They must pass through a whole series
of ranks which are conferred upon them one after another, after special trials and
ceremonies; it requires months and sometimes even years to reach the highest
rank. Now special foods are assigned to each of these ranks; the men of the
lower ranks may not touch the foods which rightfully belong to the men of the
superior ones (see Mathews, <i>Ethnol. Notes</i>, etc., <i>loc. cit.</i> pp. 262 ff.; Parker, <i>The
Euahlayi</i>, p. 23; Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nor. Tr.</i>, pp. 611 ff.; <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, pp. 470 ff.).
So the more sacred repels the less sacred; but this is because the second is
profane in relation to the first. In fine, all the interdictions arrange themselves
in two classes: the interdictions between the sacred and the profane and the
purely sacred and the impurely sacred.</p></div>

are the most important, they are far from being the only ones. We have seen
that there are foods which are forbidden to the non-initiated because they are
sacred; now very different causes may confer this character. For example, as
we shall presently see, the birds which are seen on the tops of trees are reputed
to be sacred, because they are neighbours to the great god who lives in heaven.
Thus, it is possible that for different reasons the flesh of certain animals has been
specially reserved for the old men and that consequently it has seemed to
partake of the sacred character recognized in these latter.</p></div>

say nothing because it is very hard to determine its exact nature: this is sexual
contact. There are religious periods when a man cannot have commerce with a
woman (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, pp. 293, 295; <i>Nat. Tr.</i>, p. 397). Is this because the woman
is profane or because the sexual act is dreaded? This question cannot be decided
in passing. We set it aside along with all that concerns conjugal and sexual rites.
It is too closely connected with the problems of marriage and the family to be
separated from them.</p></div>

constitutes a profanation. The profanation may be permitted or even ordered,

religious solemnities is due to the same cause. Men speak, and especially in a
high voice, during ordinary life; then, in the religious life they ought to keep
still or talk in a low voice. This same consideration is not foreign to the

first, the individual is surrounded by interdicts, the original form of the moral
interdicts which isolate and protect the human person to-day. Thus the corpse
of his victim is considered dangerous for a murderer (Spencer and Gillen, <i>Nat. Tr.</i>,
p. 492), and is taboo for him. Now the interdicts having this origin are frequently
used by individuals as a means of withdrawing certain things from common use
and thus establishing a property right over them. "When a man goes away
from the camp, leaving his arms and food there," says Roth, speaking of the
tribes on the Palmer River (North Queensland), "if he urinates near the objects
he leaves, they become <i>tami</i> (equivalent to taboo) and he may be sure of finding
them intact on his return" (<i>North Queensland Ethnography</i>, in <i>Records of the
Australian Museum</i>, Vol. VII, No. 2, p. 75). This is because the urine, like the
blood, is believed to contain some of the sacred force which is personal to the
individual. So it keeps strangers at a distance. For the same reasons, the spoken
word may also serve as a vehicle for these same influences; that is how it becomes
possible to prevent access to an object by a mere verbal declaration. This power
of making interdicts varies with different individuals; it is greater as their
character is more sacred. Men have this privilege almost to the exclusion of
women (Roth cites one single case of a taboo imposed by women); it is at its
maximum with the chiefs and old men, who use it to monopolize whatever things
they find it convenient to (Roth, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 77). Thus the religious interdict becomes
a right of property and an administrative rule.</p></div>

a magician. Just like the young neophyte, the apprentice magician is submitted
to a multitude of interdictions, the observation of which contributes to his
acquisition of his specific powers (see <i>L'Origine des pouvoirs magiques</i>, in Hubert
and Mauss, <i>M&eacute;langes d'histoire des religions</i>, pp. 171, 173, 176). The same is true
for the husband and wife on the day before and the day after the wedding (taboos
of the betrothed and newly married); this is because marriage also implies a
grave change of condition. We limit ourselves to mentioning these facts
summarily, without stopping over them; for the first concern magic, which
is not our subject, and the second have to do with that system of juridico-religious
rules which relates to the commerce of the sexes, the study of which will
be possible only in conjunction with the other precepts of primitive conjugal
morality.</p></div>

of increasing a man's magic force (<i>die menschliche Zauberkraft</i>); from this
expression, one might believe that suffering is a magic rite, not a religious one.
But as we have already pointed out, Preuss gives the name magic, without great
precision, to all anonymous and impersonal forces, whether they belong to magic
or religion. Of course, there are tortures which are used to make magicians; but
many of those which we have described are a part of the real religious ceremonies,
and, consequently, it is the religious state of the individuals which they modify.</p></div>

pp. 309-400. Under this same rubric Preuss classes a great number of incongruous
rites, for example, effusions of blood which act in virtue of the positive
qualities attributed to blood and not because of the suffering which they imply.
We retain only those in which suffering is an essential element of the rite and the
cause of its efficacy.</p></div>

rites of initiation sometimes have all the characteristics of hazing. In fact,
hazing is a real social institution which arises spontaneously every time that
two groups, inequal in their moral and social situation, come into intimate
contact. In this case, the one considering itself superior to the other resists the
intrusion of the new-comers; it reacts against them is such a way as to make
them aware of the superiority it feels. This reaction, which is produced automatically
and which takes the form of more or less grave cruelties quite naturally,
is also destined to shape the individuals for their new existence and assimilate
them into their new environment. So it is a sort of initiation. Thus it is
explained how the initiation, on its side, takes the form of hazing. It is because
the group of old men is superior in religious and moral dignity to that of the
young men, and yet the first must assimilate the second. So all the conditions for
hazing are given.</p></div>

Strehlow (III, p. 7) contests the exactness of this expression. According to him,
the rite makes real kangaroos, with living bodies, appear. But this dispute is
without interest, just as the one about the notion of the <i>ratapa</i> was (see above,
p. 252). The kangaroo germs thus escaping from the rock are not visible, so they
are not made out of the same substance as the kangaroos which we see. This is
all that Spencer and Gillen mean to say. It is quite certain, moreover, that they
are not pure spirits such as a Christian might conceive. Like human souls, they
have a material form.</p></div>

important additions. The most interesting thing taught by Strehlow on this
subject is that the effusions and oblations of blood are much more frequent than
one would suspect from the account of Spencer and Gillen (see Strehlow, III,
pp. 13, 14, 19, 29, 39, 43, 46, 56, 67, 80, 89).
</p><p>
Moreover, the information given by Strehlow in regard to the cult must be
taken carefully, for he was not a witness of the rites he describes; he confined
himself to collecting oral testimony, which is generally rather summary (see
fasc. III, Preface of Leonhardi, p. v). It may even be asked if he has not confused
the totemic ceremonies of initiation with those which he calls <i>mbatjalkatiuma</i>,
to an excessive degree. Of course, he has made a praiseworthy attempt
to distinguish them and has made two of their distinctive characteristics very
evident. In the first place, the Intichiuma always takes place at a sacred spot
to which the souvenir of some ancestor is attached, while the initiation ceremonies
may be celebrated anywhere. Secondly, the oblations of blood are special to the
Intichiuma, which proves that they are close to the heart of the ritual (III, p. 7).
But in the description which he gives us of the rites, we find facts belonging
indifferently to each species of ceremony. In fact, in what he describes under
the name mbatjalkatiuma, the young men generally take an important part (for
example, see pp. 11, 13, etc.), which is characteristic of the initiation. Also, it
seems as though the place of the rite is arbitrary, for the actors construct their
scene artificially. They dig a hole into which they go; he seldom makes any
allusion to sacred trees or rocks and their ritual r&ocirc;le.</p></div>

Spencer and Gillen. On this subject, the recent fascicule of Strehlow only confirms
the observations of his predecessors, at least on all essential points. He
recognizes that after the first ceremony (two months afterwards, he says, p. 13),
the chief of the clan eats the totemic animal or plant ritually and that after this
he raises the interdicts; he calls this operation <i>die Freigabe des Totems zum
allgemeinen Gebrauch</i> (III, p. 7). He even tells us that this operation is important
enough to have a special word for it in the Arunta language. He adds,
it is true, that this ritual consummation is not the only one, but that the chiefs
and old men sometimes eat the sacred plant or animal before the first ceremony
and that the performer of the rite does so after the celebration. The fact is not
improbable; these consummations are means employed by the officiants or
assistants to acquire virtues which they acquire; it is not surprising if they are
numerous. It does not invalidate the account of Spencer and Gillen at all, for
the rite upon which they insist, and not without reason, is the <i>Freigabe des
Totems</i>.
</p><p>
On only two points does Strehlow contest the allegations of Spencer and
Gillen. In the first place, he declares that the ritual consumption does not take
place in every case. This cannot be doubted, for there are some animals and
plants which are not edible. But still, the rite is very frequent; Strehlow himself
cites numerous examples (pp. 13, 14, 19, 23, 33, 36, 50, 59, 67, 68, 71, 75, 80, 84,
89, 93). Secondly, we have seen that according to Spencer and Gillen, if the
chief does not eat the totemic animal or plant, he will lose his powers. Strehlow
assures us that the testimony of natives does not confirm this assertion. But
this question seems to us to be quite secondary. The assured fact is that the
ritual consumption is required, so it must be thought useful or necessary. Now,
like every communion, it can only serve to confer needed virtues upon the
person communicating. It does not follow from the fact that the natives, or
some of them, have forgotten this function of the rite, that it is not real. Is it
necessary to repeat that worshippers are generally ignorant of the real reasons
for their practices?</p></div>

its features the ritual of these latter resembles that of the Arunta (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>,

who represents him (<i>der Darsteller</i>) are presented as one in these sacred
hymns." (III, p. 6). As this incontestable fact contradicts the theory according
to which ancestral souls do not reincarnate themselves, Strehlow adds,
it is true, in a note, that "in the course of the ceremony there is no real incarnation
of the ancestor in the person who represents him." If Strehlow
wishes to say that the incarnation does not take place on the occasion of the
ceremony, then nothing is more certain. But if he means that there is no
incarnation at all, we do not understand how the officiant and the ancestor can
be confounded.</p></div>

each clan is thought to be descended from one single ancestor about
whom the legendary history of the clan centres. This is the ancestor whom the
rite commemorates; now the officiant need not be descended from him. One
might even ask if these mythical chiefs, who are sorts of demigods, are submitted
to reincarnation.</p></div>

Strehlow also mentions a mythical snake among the Arunta (<i>Kulaia</i>, water-snake)
which may not differ greatly from the Wollunqua (Strehlow, I, p. 78;
cf. II, p. 71, where the Kulaia is found in a list of totems).</p></div>

occasion to describe above (p. 217), in the course of which an image of the
Wollunqua is designed on a sort of hillock which is then torn to pieces in the
midst of a general effervescence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1208_1208" id="Footnote_1208_1208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1208_1208"><span class="label">[1208]</span></a> <i>Nor. Tr.</i>, pp. 227, 248.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1209_1209" id="Footnote_1209_1209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1209_1209"><span class="label">[1209]</span></a> Here are the terms of Spencer and Gillen in the only passage in which they
speak of a possible connection between the Wollunqua and rain. A few days
after the rite about the hillock, "the old men say that they have heard Wollunqua
speak, that he was satisfied with what had passed and that he was going to send
rain. The reason for this prophecy was that they, as well as ourselves, had
heard thunder rolling at a distance." To such a slight extent is the production
of rain the immediate object of the ceremony that they did not attribute it to
Wollunqua until several days later, and then after accidental circumstances.
Another fact shows how vague the ideas of the natives are on this point. A few
lines below, thunder is spoken of as a sign, not of the Wollunqua's satisfaction,
but of its discontent. In spite of these prognostics, continue our authors, "the
rain did not fall. But some days later, they heard the thunder rolling in the
distance again. The old men said that the Wollunqua was grumbling because he
was not contented" with the way in which the rite had been celebrated. Thus
a single phenomenon, the noise of thunder, is sometimes interpreted as a sign
of a favouring disposition, and sometimes as a mark of evil intentions.
</p><p>
However, there is one detail of the ritual which, if we accept the explanation
of it proposed by Spencer and Gillen, is directly efficient. According to them,
the destruction of the hillock was intended to frighten the Wollunqua and to
prevent it, by magic constraint, from leaving its retreat. But this interpretation
seems very doubtful to us. In fact, in the very case of which we were speaking,
where it was announced that the Wollunqua was dissatisfied, this dissatisfaction
was attributed to the fact that they had neglected to take away the debris of the
hillock. So this removal is demanded by the Wollunqua itself, and in no way
intended to intimidate it and exercise a coercive influence over it. This is probably
merely one case of a more general rule which is in force among the Warramunga:
the instruments of the cult must be destroyed after each ceremony.
Thus the ritual ornamentations with which the officiants are decorated are
violently torn off from them when the rite is terminated (<i>Nor. Tr.</i>, p. 205).</p></div>

no definite object themselves, but which are mere discharges of energy (see above,
p. 381). The native does not assign them a definite end either; he merely
says that if these licences are not committed, the rite will not produce its effects;
the ceremony will fail.</p></div>

different totems are initiated at the same time. So the ceremonies which thus
succeed one another in the same place have to do with several totems, and, therefore,
they must take place away from the places with which they are connected
by the myth.</p></div>

themselves: it is because they are not a ritual entity, but are formed by the
conglomeration of rites of different sorts. There are interdictions, ascetic rites
and representative ceremonies which cannot be distinguished from those celebrated
at the time of the Intichiuma. So we had to dismember this composite
system and treat each of the different rites composing it separately, classifying
them with the similar rites to which they are to be related. We have also seen
(pp. 285 ff.) that the initiation has served as the point of departure for a new
religion which tends to surpass totemism. But it has been sufficient for us to
show that totemism contained the germs of this religion; we have had no need
of following out its development. The object of this book is to study the
elementary beliefs and practices; so we must stop at the moment when they
give birth to more complex forms.</p></div>

which follows upon mourning. The funeral ceremonies are frequently very long;
they include many operations which take place at intervals during many months.
Thus they prolong and support the moral disturbance brought about by the
death (cf. Hertz, <i>La Representation collective de la mort</i>, in <i>Ann&eacute;e Sociol.</i>, X,
pp. 48 ff.). In a general way, a death marks a grave change of condition which
has extended and enduring effects upon the group. It takes a long time to
neutralize these effects.</p></div>

mourning cut off a part of their beards, which they throw on to the corpse (<i>ibid.</i>,

transformations. According to him, if the expiatory victim served to purify, it
was because it had nothing impure in itself. At first, it was a holy thing; it was
destined to re-establish, by means of a communion, the bonds of kinship uniting
the worshipper to his god, when a ritual fault had strained or broken them. An
exceptionally holy animal was chosen for this operation in order that the communion
might be as efficacious as possible, and efface the effects of the fault as
completely as possible. It was only when they no longer understood the meaning
of the rite that the sacrosanct animal was considered impure (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 347 ff.).
But it is inadmissible that beliefs and practices as universal as these, which we
find at the foundation of the expiatory sacrifice, should be the product of a mere
error of interpretation. In fact, we cannot doubt that the expiatory victim was
charged with the impurity of the sin. We have shown, moreover, that these
transformations of the pure into the impure, or the contrary, are to be found in
the most inferior societies which we know.</p></div>

religion: that is economic activity. Sometimes processes that are derived from
magic have, by that fact alone, an origin that is indirectly religious. Also,
economic value is a sort of power or efficacy, and we know the religious origins of
the idea of power. Also, richness can confer <i>mana</i>; therefore it has it. Hence
it is seen that the ideas of economic value and of religious value are not without
connection. But the question of the nature of these connections has not yet been
studied.</p></div>

they are very different things. What we mean by universality is the property
which the concept has of being communicable to a number of minds, and in
principle, to all minds; but this communicability is wholly independent of the
degree of its extension. A concept which is applied to only one object, and
whose extension is consequently at the minimum, can be the same for everybody:
such is the case with the concept of a deity.</p></div>

thinking and acting become fixed and crystallized in the individual, in the form of
habits which resist change. But a habit is only a tendency to repeat an act or
idea automatically every time that the same circumstances appear; it does not
at all imply that the idea or act is in the form of an exemplary type, proposed to or
imposed upon the mind or will. It is only when a type of this sort is set up, that
is to say, when a rule or standard is established, that social action can and should
be presumed.</p></div>
